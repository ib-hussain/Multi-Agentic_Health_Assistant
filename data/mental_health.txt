How to show emotional support

Emotional support is showing care and compassion for another person. It can be verbal or nonverbal. It may include actions such as helping a person call a therapist or giving a hug to a crying friend. Emotional support can help a person cope with their emotions and experiences and show them that they are not alone. This can make a substantial difference to a person’s health and happiness. The American Psychological Association’s 2022 Stress in America report found that emotional support correlated with lower stress levels and higher rates of well-being. The researchers found that 52% of people who felt that they needed more emotional support during the COVID-19 pandemic said that their life stress had increased, compared with the 27% who reported having adequate emotional support.

Effective emotional support is respectful, non-judgmental, compassionate, unconditional, and person-centered. It means treating the person in need with dignity, avoiding judgment of their feelings or perspective, offering reassurance and understanding, not expecting anything in return, and focusing on their wants and needs.

Examples of emotional support include active listening, empathizing and validating, showing love and care, offering encouragement, and providing practical help when needed. Active listening involves giving full attention, letting the person speak without interruption, asking clarifying questions, and reflecting back what they say to show understanding.

Empathizing and validating can involve saying things like “That must be so hard” or “It’s normal to feel a mixture of things right now.” Offering emotional presence might sound like “I love you no matter what” or “I’m here for you.” When advice is appropriate, it’s helpful to ask, “Would you like my opinion?” rather than giving unsolicited suggestions.

Material support can include giving someone a ride, helping with childcare, or making a phone call on their behalf if they’re feeling overwhelmed.

To be emotionally supportive, listen with empathy and without judgment. Reflect their emotions to show you understand. Offer compassion and be honest about your limitations. Ask them what they need from you and respect their preferences.

There are also important things to avoid when offering support. Don’t minimize someone’s pain or tell them to look on the bright side. Don’t interrupt or compare their experience to others’. Avoid making it about yourself, and don’t pressure them to talk if they’re not ready. If you feel overwhelmed, it’s okay to express that kindly and suggest other ways to help.

If someone wants to ask for emotional support, it’s helpful to choose someone they trust, communicate clearly about what they need, and be open to receiving help. Emotional support may not solve problems but can offer comfort, validation, and a sense of connection. Even if support looks small, it can be meaningful when given with genuine care.
How to Be Emotionally Supportive: 13 Tips, Tools, and Strategies

Offering emotional support typically involves asking questions, listening, and then providing validation and the type of support a person needs, whether physical closeness or something else.

Support comes in many forms.

You might offer physical support to someone having trouble standing or walking, or financial support to a loved one in a tight spot.

Other kinds of support are important, too. People in your life like family members, friends, and even close co-workers, can help lift you up emotionally by offering social and emotional support.

People show emotional support for others by offering genuine encouragement, reassurance, and compassion. This might include things like verbal expressions of sympathy or physical gestures of affection.

Emotional support can come from other sources, too — religious or spiritual sources, community activities, or even your pets. Whatever form it takes, this support can improve anyone’s outlook and general wellness.

Some people have a knack for being emotionally supportive, but this skill doesn’t come naturally to everyone. You can develop these skills, though, with a little practice.

Ask…

When you want to provide emotional support to someone you care about, asking a few questions is a great place to start.

“How can I support you?” can sometimes work, but it’s not always the best approach. While good intentions lie behind questions like these, they sometimes fail to have the impact you desire.

People don’t always know what they want or need, especially in the middle of a difficult situation. So, this question can be so broad it leaves someone unsure how to reply.

Instead, try asking questions tailored to a situation or the person’s state of mind, such as:

“You seem a little upset today. Would you like to talk about it?”

“I know your boss was giving you a tough time. How have you been holding up?”

If you know someone has faced some challenges and aren’t sure how to open a conversation, try starting with some general questions, such as, “What’s been happening in your life lately?”

Try to keep your questions open-ended instead of asking questions that can be answered with a “yes” or a “no.” This invites an explanation and helps keep the discussion going.

…and listen

It’s not enough to simply ask questions. Listening actively, or empathically, is another important part of providing emotional support.

When you really listen to someone, you give them your full attention. Show interest in their words by continuing the conversation, reflecting back what you hear, and asking thoughtful follow-up questions.

This means putting your phone down, turning off the TV, and making eye contact as you chat. You might nod occasionally to show you’re still with them, but otherwise just listen.

Avoid interrupting or offering advice unless they ask for it. Just be there and let them share, no matter how long it takes.

Validate

Validation means acknowledging a person’s feelings, not dismissing them, even if you don’t quite understand or agree.

When someone shares something painful, avoid responses like “That’s not such a big deal” or “That could be worse.” These can come off as invalidating or dismissive, even if you mean well.

Instead, say things like:

“That sounds so difficult. I’m really sorry you’re experiencing this.”

“I can see why you’d feel that way.”

“It makes sense you’re upset. I think I’d feel the same way.”

These phrases can help someone feel seen and understood. Validation doesn’t mean you agree with everything they say — it just shows you respect their experience.

Show interest and appreciation

You can validate someone without using words, too. Show that you care by being attentive, nodding, or making encouraging sounds like “mhmm” or “I see.”

If they’re doing their best to cope, you might say:

“I really admire how you’ve been handling this.”

“Thank you for trusting me with this. That means a lot.”

Recognizing their efforts can go a long way in helping someone feel supported.

Affection and reassurance

Affection can also communicate emotional support, especially in close relationships.

Offering a hug, sitting beside them, or even placing a hand on their shoulder can provide comfort. If you’re not sure what’s appropriate, just ask.

Reassuring someone that you care about them can also help. Try phrases like:

“I’m here for you.”

“You’re not alone.”

“I care about you, and I want to help.”

Respect their process

Everyone copes in different ways, and your idea of what works might not be helpful to someone else.

It can be hard to see someone you care about struggling, but try to avoid pushing them to do what you think is best. Trust that they know what they need, and let them take the lead.

If they’re not ready to talk or don’t want help, respect that. You can still let them know you’re there when they’re ready.

Offer tangible support

Sometimes emotional support includes practical help.

If someone seems overwhelmed, offer to take care of tasks like running errands, cooking a meal, or watching their kids.

You might say:

“Would it help if I brought over dinner tonight?”

“I’m going to the store later — want me to pick up anything?”

“Need someone to keep you company this weekend?”

Don’t push, but make your offers specific so they’re easier to accept.

Touch base regularly

One conversation can make a big difference, but ongoing support matters, too.

Check in with the person after a few days to see how they’re doing. Even a quick message can remind them that you’re there.

You might text, call, or ask to meet up again. Try:

“Just wanted to see how you’re doing.”

“Thinking of you — here if you need anything.”

Let them lead the conversation, and listen with the same care and attention as before.

Know your limits

Supporting someone emotionally doesn’t mean solving all their problems.

It’s OK to admit if you don’t have all the answers or feel out of your depth. In fact, being honest about this can build trust.

You might say:

“I want to help, but I’m not sure what to do. Maybe we can figure it out together.”

Encourage them to talk to a therapist or counselor if they’re really struggling. Offer to help find someone or go with them if they’d like.

Take care of yourself

Being there for someone else is important, but so is taking care of your own well-being.

Supporting a loved one can be emotionally draining, especially if you’re also dealing with your own stress.

Make time for rest, hobbies, and other relationships. If you start feeling overwhelmed, it’s OK to take a step back and recharge.

Remember, emotional support doesn’t have to be perfect. Just showing up, listening, and offering kindness can mean a lot.
5 steps to mental wellbeing

Evidence suggests there are 5 steps you can take to improve your mental health and wellbeing. Trying these things could help you feel more positive and able to get the most out of life.

1. Connect with other people
   Good relationships are important for your mental wellbeing. They can help you to build a sense of belonging and self‑worth, give you an opportunity to share positive experiences, provide emotional support and allow you to support others. There are lots of things you could try to help build stronger and closer relationships, such as taking time each day to be with family, arranging a day out with friends, switching off the TV to play a game or talk, having lunch with a colleague, visiting someone who needs company, volunteering, or using technology to stay in touch. Avoid relying only on social media or messaging.

2. Be physically active
   Being active is not only great for your physical health and fitness—but it can also improve mental wellbeing by raising your self‑esteem, helping you set and achieve challenges, and causing beneficial chemical changes in your brain. You don’t need to spend hours in the gym. Find activities you enjoy and make them part of your routine—even simple things like walking, aerobics, strength and flexibility work are useful.

3. Learn new skills
   Research shows that learning new skills can improve your mental wellbeing by boosting self‑confidence, giving you a sense of purpose, and helping you connect with others. You can try things like cooking something new, taking on a new responsibility at work, DIY, signing up for a course, learning a language or picking up a hobby that interests you. You don’t have to pursue qualifications—just enjoy learning something new in a way that fits your interests.

4. Give to others
   Acts of giving and kindness can improve your mental wellbeing by creating positive feelings, purpose and a sense of reward, and helping you connect with other people. This can include small acts like saying thank you, really listening when someone asks how you are, helping with a task, spending time with someone who needs support, or volunteering in your community.

5. Pay attention to the present moment (mindfulness)
   Paying attention to the present moment can improve your mental wellbeing. This includes being aware of your thoughts and feelings, your body, and the world around you. Sometimes this is called mindfulness. It can help you enjoy life more and understand yourself better, positively affecting how you feel and how you face challenges.

Self‑care means taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve both your physical health and mental health. This can help you manage stress, lower your risk of illness, and increase your energy. Even small acts of self‑care in your daily life can have a big impact.

Here are some self‑care tips:

Get regular exercise. Just 30 minutes of walking every day can boost your mood and improve your health. Small amounts of exercise add up, so don’t be discouraged if you can’t do 30 minutes at one time.

Eat healthy, regular meals and stay hydrated. A balanced diet and plenty of water can improve your energy and focus throughout the day. Pay attention to your intake of caffeine and alcohol and how they affect your mood and well‑being—for some, decreasing caffeine and alcohol consumption can be helpful.

Make sleep a priority. Stick to a schedule, and make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Blue light from devices and screens can make it harder to fall asleep, so reduce blue light exposure from your phone or computer before bedtime.
What Is Emotional Regulation? A Definition

Emotional regulation is a dynamic and multifaceted process by which we experience and express our emotions. It can be conscious, such as actively deciding to calm yourself down after a stressful meeting, or unconscious, such as automatically feeling relief after a deep breath.

According to Gross (1998), emotional regulation refers to the processes by which individuals influence which emotions they have, when they have them, and how they experience and express them.

It involves a variety of strategies that can affect the type, intensity, duration, and expression of emotions. These strategies can be automatic or controlled, conscious or unconscious, and may have short- or long-term effects on our well-being and functioning.

The Importance of Emotion Regulation

Effective emotion regulation is vital for mental health and well-being. It can help individuals manage stress, reduce the risk of mental disorders, and improve interpersonal relationships.

When we fail to regulate our emotions effectively, it can lead to difficulties such as mood swings, impulsivity, and problems in social and professional settings.

Emotion regulation plays a key role in resilience—the ability to bounce back from adversity—as it helps individuals maintain a sense of control and purpose during challenging times.

Poor emotion regulation is linked to various psychological conditions, including anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder, and substance abuse. Therefore, enhancing emotional regulation skills can be a central focus in therapy and personal development.

Emotional Regulation vs. Emotional Dysregulation

Emotional regulation involves strategies to manage emotions constructively, while emotional dysregulation refers to difficulties in controlling emotional responses. People experiencing emotional dysregulation may have intense emotional reactions, struggle to return to a calm state, and find it difficult to express emotions in appropriate ways.

This can impair their relationships, work performance, and overall quality of life. Emotional dysregulation is often a feature of psychological disorders and is a primary treatment target in therapies like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).

Types of Emotion Regulation Strategies

There are two broad categories of emotion regulation strategies: antecedent-focused and response-focused.

Antecedent-focused strategies occur before an emotional response is fully generated. These include:

* Situation selection: Avoiding or approaching certain situations.
* Situation modification: Changing aspects of a situation to alter its emotional impact.
* Attentional deployment: Redirecting attention to influence emotions.
* Cognitive change: Reappraising the meaning of a situation.

Response-focused strategies occur after an emotional response has been generated. These include:

* Suppression: Inhibiting the outward signs of inner feelings.
* Expression: Expressing emotions constructively.
* Relaxation: Engaging in techniques to reduce emotional intensity.

5 Proven Techniques for Emotion Regulation

1. Cognitive Reappraisal
   This involves changing how you think about a situation to alter its emotional impact. For example, seeing a failed job interview as a learning experience rather than a personal failure.

2. Mindfulness
   Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention to the present moment with acceptance. It helps individuals observe their emotions without judgment and reduce emotional reactivity.

3. Acceptance
   Rather than avoiding or fighting emotions, acceptance involves acknowledging emotions as they are. This approach reduces avoidance behaviors and increases psychological flexibility.

4. Problem-Solving
   Problem-solving involves identifying practical steps to change a distressing situation. It reduces helplessness and provides a sense of control.

5. Relaxation Techniques
   These include deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery. They help down-regulate the physiological arousal associated with intense emotions.
Tips to Help Regulate Emotions Effectively
* Name your emotions: Identifying what you’re feeling is the first step toward managing it.
* Understand the triggers: Recognizing what causes intense emotions can help prevent them.
* Practice self-compassion: Treat yourself with kindness when emotions are strong.
* Use grounding techniques: Bring yourself back to the present moment during emotional distress.
* Engage in physical activity: Exercise helps reduce stress hormones and improves mood.
* Build emotional awareness: Journaling or talking with a therapist can enhance understanding.

Final Thoughts

Emotion regulation is a crucial skill that influences mental health, relationships, and overall well-being. It can be developed and strengthened through practice and the use of evidence-based strategies.

Whether you're managing daily stress or facing major life challenges, emotional regulation techniques can help you respond more effectively, reduce suffering, and enhance your quality of life.

Providing emotional support and daily emotional well‑being among undergraduate students during the COVID‑19 pandemic

Receiving emotional support can improve one’s emotional well‑being, but findings have been mixed regarding whether providing emotional support to friends and family can also improve the provider’s emotional well‑being. Providing emotional support could be impactful during the COVID‑19 pandemic, when individuals may be particularly in need of emotional support and social connection. Therefore, the present study assessed whether providing emotional support was related to role fulfillment and enhanced emotional well‑being on a day‑to‑day basis during the COVID‑19 pandemic. Participants (N = 167; Mₐgₑ = 20.42, SD = 2.30; 73.1% female; 40.1% Asian, 18.6% Latinx, 16.8% white) completed up to eight daily checklists (M checklists = 6.54, SD = 2.10) in which they reported whether they provided emotional support to their friends and to their parents, their role fulfillment (i.e., the extent to which they felt like a good son/daughter and friend), and the degree of positive and negative emotion they were feeling. Participants reported higher positive emotion and lower negative emotion on days when they provided emotional support to friends, but not to parents, with potentially stronger associations in‑person than virtually. Participants also reported higher role fulfillment as a good son/daughter and a good friend on days when they provided emotional support, and role fulfillment significantly mediated associations between providing emotional support and daily emotion. Taken together, results suggested that providing emotional support to friends—particularly in‑person—was related to better emotional well‑being by promoting a sense of role fulfillment as a good friend. Providing emotional support may provide one means for reinforcing social relationships and promoting emotional well‑being during times of social isolation.
The Different Methods of Providing Emotional Support

Having a support system around us is an important factor when we are struggling to deal with the challenging life events or the emotions that arise as we work through unresolved past traumas. A support system refers to those around us that love us and have our best interests at heart. These individuals can be family members, close friends, colleagues, support groups or mental health professionals, and all play an essential role when we are not feeling so strong. Our source of support allows us to better cope with the situation or our emotions about an event. However, each of us have unique needs when it comes to support and likewise each of us provides support to others in a unique way, and whilst the best intentions are there to assist in providing emotional support, at times our ways of providing support may be different and incompatible with the needs of the person who requires it.

METHODS OF SUPPORT

There are different ways to provide support and the way we support someone can be based on their personality or it can be situation dependent. Here is an outline of ways to support someone and some examples of when it can be effective or not.

Support through guidance or advice

This method entails providing advice or assistance regarding the situation, this can be helpful when someone feels so overwhelmed that they are unable to make sense of things in that moment and this approach can help someone to get some perspective and see that there are some options and provide some hope that a way forward is possible and can include suggestions of seeking professional help to better manage their emotions or the guidance received through therapeutic interventions. This approach is appropriate when someone has feelings of overwhelm or hopelessness, and you, as the support, are in a position to offer insight. This approach can be used if someone asks specifically for guidance but can be unhelpful if we offer unsolicited advice to someone who requires a different approach to support. We need to practice this approach with caution if we are not experts in the area or have no relevant experience of our own to draw from.

The opposite approach to giving advice is to simply listen, this works best when someone just needs to get something out, to ‘vent’ about a situation and to talk. The support provided by listening without countering anything or interrupting by excessive commenting, means that the individual feels that they can disclose information honestly in a way that is not judged. This approach should involve active listening techniques whereby we can nod to agree or to ask short open-ended questions to allow for the person to explore the situation in more detail. An open-ended question cannot be answered by a yes or no, and therefore encourages further discussion through explanation or clarification. This shows that we are really listening, and that the person has our full attention, and that their situation matters to us.
Practicing Mindfulness
We all want learners to feel more calm, focused, regulated, and happy. Mindfulness is one of the best techniques to cultivate these qualities. Teaching mindful breathing—like Shape Breathing or Bubble Breathing—is a simple, effective practice.

Positive Affirmations
Morning positive self-talk can greatly improve confidence and perseverance. Encourage creating and repeating individualized affirmation lists.

SEL Journaling
Assign daily journal prompts that help students reflect on emotions and SEL skills. This practice builds self-awareness and discussion. It also becomes a record to revisit.

Practicing Coping Strategies
Help students discover personalized strategies to manage stress and emotions—coloring, jumping jacks, breathing exercises, etc.—and practice them regularly.

SEL Question of the Day
Pose a reflective question each morning to spark discussion and build social-emotional awareness (e.g. “What does determination mean to you?”).

Greetings
Greet each student by name as they enter the room. This builds belonging and reduces challenging behavior.

Brain Breaks
Offer structured breaks with movement or mindfulness—like stretching, Simon Says, drawing, or mindful breathing—during transitions.

Relationship‑Building Chats
Use starters or questions to foster connections, empathy, and communication among students.

Real‑Life Scenarios
Present real-world dilemmas and ask, “What would you do?” Students discuss and reflect on decision-making and social skills.

Organization Time
Reserve time each day for students to organize their materials—building executive functioning and emotional routine.

Morning Meeting
Begin with greetings, introduce an SEL topic, have a group discussion, do a short activity, and then reflect before transitioning.

Emotions Check‑in
Pause to name an emotion. Reflect on it, consider needs, and practice accepting feelings. Checking in daily promotes self-regulation.
16 Simple Ways to Relieve Stress and Anxiety

1. Get more physical activity
   Exercise is one of the most important things you can do to combat stress. It lowers your body’s stress hormones over time, such as cortisol. It also helps release endorphins, which are chemicals that improve your mood and act as natural painkillers. Exercise can also improve your sleep quality, which can be negatively affected by stress and anxiety. Try activities like walking, dancing, climbing, or yoga.

2. Eat a balanced diet
   Your diet affects every aspect of your health, including your mental health. Eating a diet full of ultra-processed foods and added sugars may increase stress and anxiety. Chronic stress may lead to overeating and reaching for highly palatable foods, which may harm your overall health and mood. Minimize intake of processed foods and focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.

3. Minimize screen time
   Too much screen time can increase stress and anxiety levels, especially if it's social media or news related. Prolonged screen time may disrupt sleep, affect self-esteem, and increase feelings of isolation. Try reducing your use of screens when possible and taking breaks, especially before bedtime.

4. Practice self-care
   Make time for yourself. Self-care can include sleep hygiene, exercise, hobbies, spending time in nature, or simply doing things that make you feel good. Regular self-care can improve your overall well-being and reduce stress.

5. Try journaling
   Journaling is a powerful tool for managing stress and anxiety. It helps you process your emotions, reflect on your day, and express gratitude. Gratitude journaling, in particular, may help relieve stress and promote a more positive mindset.

6. Reduce your caffeine intake
   Caffeine is a stimulant found in coffee, tea, chocolate, and energy drinks. High doses can increase anxiety and disrupt sleep, which can worsen stress. Consider reducing caffeine consumption if you notice it makes you jittery or anxious.

7. Spend time with loved ones
   Social support from friends and family can help you get through stressful times. Being part of a support system gives you a sense of belonging and self-worth. Face-to-face interactions may release hormones that counteract stress.

8. Create boundaries
   Setting boundaries and saying no is important for mental well-being. Taking on too many responsibilities can increase stress. Learn to say no to tasks or events that might overload your schedule.

9. Avoid procrastination
   Procrastination can lead to last-minute scrambling and increased stress levels. Get organized, make to-do lists, and set realistic goals. Prioritize what needs to be done and tackle tasks early to reduce stress.

10. Practice yoga
    Yoga combines physical movement, breathing exercises, and meditation. It’s effective at reducing stress and anxiety, promoting relaxation, and improving mood. Regular practice can lead to long-term stress resilience.

11. Practice mindfulness
    Mindfulness is a technique that anchors you in the present moment. It involves meditation, breathing techniques, and body scans. It reduces negative thinking and can improve emotional regulation.

12. Cuddle
    Physical touch, such as cuddling, hugging, or holding hands, can help release oxytocin, a hormone that promotes bonding and reduces stress. It may also lower blood pressure and heart rate.

13. Get outside
    Spending time in nature can reduce stress, improve mood, and enhance well-being. Even short periods outside, like a walk in the park or sitting in the sun, can help calm your mind.

14. Take deep breaths
    Deep breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which controls the relaxation response. Try breathing techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing or box breathing to help reduce anxiety.

15. Spend time with pets
    Interacting with animals can release positive neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. Pets provide companionship and a sense of purpose. Even watching fish in an aquarium may lower stress.

16. Consider supplements
    Certain supplements may help reduce stress and anxiety. Common options include ashwagandha, omega-3 fatty acids, green tea (L-theanine), and lemon balm. Always speak to a healthcare provider before starting new supplements.

Managing stress is crucial for overall well-being. Simple lifestyle changes and daily habits can help reduce anxiety and build emotional resilience over time.

Motivation is the psychological force that drives actions, helping you pursue goals and overcome challenges. It comes from biological, emotional, social, and cognitive sources, and plays a key role in starting, directing, and maintaining goal-focused behavior.

There are three main components of motivation:

Activation: starting something

Persistence: continuing despite obstacles

Intensity: the energy and focus applied toward a goal

Types of motivation include:

Intrinsic motivation: doing things for internal satisfaction, enjoyment, or interest

Extrinsic motivation: doing things for external rewards or to avoid punishment

Family-related motivation: driven by responsibilities toward family

Motivation can change due to stress, health issues, or mental health challenges like depression or apathy.
Theories that explain how motivation works include Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, drive theory, arousal theory, and self-determination theory.

Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic motivation is driven by enjoyment or interest in the activity itself.

Extrinsic motivation comes from external rewards or pressures.
External rewards can sometimes reduce intrinsic motivation—a phenomenon known as the overjustification effect—but praise and supportive feedback can boost it if framed correctly.

Self-Determination Theory highlights three basic psychological needs that support intrinsic drive:

Autonomy: feeling in control

Competence: feeling capable

Relatedness: feeling connected
When these needs are met, people are more self-motivated and engaged.
What is Motivation
Motivation is the desire to act in order to reach a goal. It’s what pushes you to start, keep going, and put effort into something that matters to you.

Three Main Parts of Motivation

Activation – Starting a task or behavior

Persistence – Continuing, even when things get tough

Intensity – How much effort you put in

Types of Motivation

Intrinsic Motivation – Doing something because you enjoy it or find it meaningful

Extrinsic Motivation – Doing something for a reward or to avoid punishment

Family-Related Motivation – Doing things out of responsibility or care for loved ones

What Affects Motivation

Needs and goals

Emotions

Environment

Beliefs about success or failure

Past experiences

Common Motivation Theories

Self-Determination Theory – Motivation is stronger when you feel in control, capable, and connected to others

Drive Reduction Theory – You act to reduce discomfort or fulfill needs

Expectancy-Value Theory – Motivation depends on how much you want something and how likely you think you can get it

How to Stay Motivated

Set clear, realistic goals

Break big goals into smaller steps

Start with something easy to build momentum

Focus on why the goal matters to you

Celebrate small wins

Learn from mistakes instead of giving up

Take care of your physical and mental health

Ask for help or support if you need it

Why Motivation Matters
Without motivation, it’s hard to start or finish anything. It helps with personal growth, mental health, and achieving success. Low motivation over time can affect your mood, energy, and quality of life.
Tips for Staying Motivated:

Set realistic and specific goals. Breaking big goals into smaller steps helps keep momentum.

Pick activities you enjoy. You’re more likely to stick with them.

Build a routine—schedule your efforts like appointments and stick to them.

Keep track of progress with a diary or checklist. This helps you see how far you've come.

Reward yourself when you follow through. This strengthens your commitment.

Remind yourself of why it matters to do it in the first place.

Expect setbacks—don’t let them stop you. Instead, plan how to bounce back.

How Motivation Builds Habits:

Start with a small action—like spending just one minute on a task or making the bed.

Celebrate that small win to build internal momentum.

Repeat consistently across days to turn actions into habits.

Over time, motivation becomes more natural and less forced.

Why These Steps Work:

Small, consistent steps build confidence.

Tracking progress provides visual proof of improvement.

Enjoying the process makes motivation easier to maintain.

Planning rewards and meaning behind actions builds lasting internal drive.
Motivation Tips for Depression 

Start small
Do one tiny thing, like brushing your teeth or changing clothes.

Move a little
Go for a short walk or stretch. It can help lift your mood.

Go outside
Fresh air and sunlight can make you feel better.

Avoid stress
Stay away from negative news or people. Choose calm and positive things.

Be kind to yourself
It’s okay to rest. Don’t blame yourself for feeling low.

Create a small routine
Break tasks into tiny steps. Celebrate small wins.

Remember it’s not your fault
Depression makes things harder. It’s not laziness.

Do something easy
Pick one simple task—anything you can finish.

Eat and sleep well
Try healthy food, drink water, and get enough rest.

Ask for help
Talk to a friend, therapist, or doctor. Support makes a difference.

What to do when you're lacking motivation

Practice self-care and be gentle with yourself. Accept how you feel right now—it’s okay not to be okay sometimes.

Notice the little things. Praise yourself for every small task you complete. Small wins add up fast.

Try mindfulness. Focus on what you’re doing in the moment, even simple acts like getting out of bed or brushing your teeth.

At the end of each day, note three small accomplishments. Even the tiniest progress is worth celebrating.

Take some ‘me time’. Spend time doing things you enjoy—whether it’s exploring nature or relaxing alone.

Be kind to yourself. Accept your current state without judgment and reach out for help if you need it.

Stay present. Focus on each moment rather than overwhelming yourself with future tasks.

Consider attending workshops or events. Self-esteem or motivation-building courses can be helpful.

Ask for help if you need it. Talking to friends, family, or professionals can support your path forward.

How Does Your Mental Health Impact Your Motivation?

Talking to this community and our own loved ones, we’ve been hearing the same thing over and over lately — “I’m not nearly as motivated as I used to be.” “I’ve lost my drive and I don’t know why.” “My usual passion and spark feel a little dimmer.”

Sound familiar? If so, you’re not alone. This ‘blah’ feeling has become more common and is now called languishing—a state between depression and flourishing.

The Motivation/Mental Health Connection

Motivation is what energizes and inspires us, and mental health affects that in every way. If someone is in an emotional state of distress—such as anxiety, depression, grief, or trauma—motivation is directly impacted. If we’re in survival mode, being energized and inspired isn’t possible.

Mental health conditions often associated with low motivation include:

Depression causes fatigue, low energy, concentration issues, sleep changes, and low self-esteem.

Anxiety causes physical symptoms (racing heart, shakiness, upset stomach) that disrupt focus.

ADHD makes initiating and sustaining tasks difficult.

Even without clinical conditions, perfectionism or fear of failure can stop us from starting anything. External stress like burnout, illness, life changes, or collective stress can lead to emotional exhaustion, reducing drive.

When to Seek Support

Motivation naturally fluctuates, but seek professional help if:

Your dip in motivation has lasted a long time.

You can’t identify a clear trigger.

It impacts multiple areas of your life (work, relationships, daily tasks).

Therapy can help you address stuck patterns and regain energy.

How to Reclaim Your Spark

Expert-suggested ways to gently boost motivation:

Start small
Set tiny, specific goals (“just put feet on the floor,” “text two friends”). Small wins build momentum. Acknowledge every step you take.

Look for inner fulfillment
Focus on activities that bring internal joy—not external rewards. Examples: volunteering, social connection, music, dancing—things that activate your brain's reward system.

Recruit accountability buddies
Share goals with someone else. Working with a friend or checking in weekly can boost motivation by offering support and social accountability.

Practice mindfulness
Ground yourself in the present through breathing, meditation, yoga, or journaling. Staying present helps you take actionable steps.

Prioritize self-care
Emotional exhaustion often comes from neglecting basic needs. Refuel yourself with rest, movement, nature, meditation, or other soothing activities.

Make time for play
Allow yourself joy without productivity expectations. Doodle, color, watch nostalgic movies—do something just for the fun of it.

Go easy on yourself
Your worth isn’t defined by how much you do. Let go of the pressure to be constantly productive. Give yourself permission to rest and enjoy life.

This study investigated the daily associations of needed support, received support, and the balance between needed and received support with emotional well‑being. Data were collected from younger adults over time to assess how well-being fluctuates based on their support experiences. A key finding was that when the level of support received closely matched what individuals felt they needed—a state called “support balance”—participants reported better emotional and physical well‑being on that day.

The predicted beneficial association between a match of needed and received support (a support balance) and well‑being was confirmed among younger adults.

Some people deal with stress by talking about their feelings—this is called emotional approach coping. This study looked at how people use this style in romantic relationships.

It found that people who like to express and process emotions are more likely to give and receive emotional support with their partners. These people also feel better emotionally on days when they do this.

In short:

If you talk about your feelings, you're more likely to support your partner and feel supported.

This emotional sharing can improve daily mood and well-being.

Emotional support can include non-verbal behaviors like hugging, holding hands, and attentive eye contact, which convey comfort and security. These actions are intended to help others cope with stress or emotional pain.
Sensitive emotional support makes recipients feel better, helps them handle problems more effectively, and strengthens relationships. In contrast, insensitive support can hurt more—it may harm coping, erode trust, and even lead to stress-related illness. 

Burleson’s 1994 hierarchical framework categorizes comforting messages by how much they focus on the recipient’s emotional experience. Highly person‑centered messages explicitly recognize, elaborate on, and legitimize a person’s feelings. Moderate messages acknowledge feelings within a broader context. Low‑person‑centered messages dismiss or challenge the person’s emotions or tell them how they should feel. 

Barbee & Cunningham’s typology describes four coping-based support behaviors:

Solace behaviors: approach-based and emotion-focused to express closeness and positive feeling.

Solve behaviors: approach-based and problem-focused to offer solutions.

Escape behaviors: avoidance-based and emotion-focused to discourage feeling emotions.

Dismiss behaviors: avoidance-based and problem-focused, minimizing the significance of the problem.
Solace strategies and highly person-centered messages are generally seen as the most sensitive and effective for providing emotional support. 
Research confirms these patterns across cultures and genders: people tend to seek comfort and ego support in close relationships, with expressive communication at the core. While some differences exist by culture or gender, comforting and empathy are widely valued. 
Simple Emotion Regulation Strategy Types (By Function and Target)

1. Attention-Based Strategies
Focus on shifting your attention away from negative emotions.
Example: Distracting yourself with music or a task when you're upset.

2. Appraisal-Based Strategies
Change how you think about a situation.
Example: Telling yourself “this isn’t the end of the world” or finding a positive side.

3. Body-Based Strategies
Calm your physical reaction to emotions.
Example: Deep breathing, relaxing your muscles, or going for a walk.

Purpose of These Strategies:

Feel better (pleasure > pain)

Stay focused on goals

Protect long-term well-being

Motivation is the process that drives us to take action toward goals. It comes from brain systems that respond to rewards and help us make decisions, stay focused, and put in effort.

The brain area most linked to motivation is the dopamine system, especially the pathway between the ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex. This system gives us the feeling of wanting or desiring something. When we expect a reward, dopamine is released, which pushes us to act.

The prefrontal cortex helps us plan, focus, and control impulses. It uses information about goals and rewards to decide which actions are worth doing. Motivation is not just about rewards. It also depends on how much effort we think something will take and how likely we think we are to succeed.

Motivation connects to other mental functions like attention, learning, memory, and emotion. For example, when we are motivated, we pay more attention, remember things better, and learn faster. Emotion and mood also affect motivation. Feeling positive boosts motivation, while stress or sadness can reduce it.

There are two main types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation comes from doing something because it is enjoyable or meaningful. Extrinsic motivation comes from wanting a reward or to avoid punishment.

Both types involve brain systems that handle rewards, emotions, and thinking. But intrinsic motivation is more connected to long-term engagement and personal growth.

Motivation increases when we feel in control, when we feel capable, and when we feel connected to others. These three needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—are important for keeping motivation strong.

When these needs are not met, motivation drops. This is common in mental health conditions like depression, where people often lose the drive to do things they used to enjoy.

Understanding motivation helps us improve learning, work performance, and mental health. By knowing how the brain creates motivation, we can find better ways to support people and help them reach their goals.

Emotion regulation (ER) is about how people manage their emotions using different strategies and goals. Researchers reviewed 139 academic articles published between 2019 and 2023 to understand how various ER models describe both strategies (what people do) and goals (why they do it).

Key points:

Ten main ER models were identified. The two most common are Gross’s Process Model and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation model.

Most ER strategies are cognitive—focused on our thoughts and interpretations.

The primary goals of these strategies are:

Hedonic goals: seeking comfort or avoiding unpleasant emotions

Instrumental goals: managing emotions to achieve practical outcomes

Classical theories from thinkers like Aristotle, Descartes, and Darwin also influenced modern ER models. However, some older ideas—like personal growth or physical balance—are not commonly integrated anymore.

Study methods:

Researchers systematically reviewed major psychology theory databases.

Articles were selected if they described ER models or frameworks in either healthy or emotionally challenged individuals.

Conclusions:

There is a lot of overlap among ER models—they share similar strategies and goals.

Most modern models focus on thinking-based strategies for immediate emotional relief or control.

Understanding both strategies and goals clearly is important to compare studies, identify gaps, and build better frameworks in emotion-related research.

Flourishing is an optimal state of wellbeing, but the mechanisms that enable flourishing are unclear. This study examined the role of emotion regulation (ER) strategies that may enable flourishing. The first aim examined differences between flourishers and non-flourishers in the use of functional/adaptive and dysfunctional/maladaptive ER strategies. A second aim specifically compared differences between flourishers and those non-flourishers who were free of psychopathology. We hypothesised that flourishers utilise greater use of functional/adaptive and lower use of dysfunctional/maladaptive strategies in comparison with non-flourishers, and those without pathology. Australian adults (N = 292) completed measures of flourishing, depression, and anxiety, and two measures of emotion regulation. Quota sampling obtained a balanced sample by age-group and gender. Regression analyses regressed ER strategies on flourishing and depression/anxiety status, adjusting for socio-demographic covariates. ER measures included the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) to assess reappraisal and suppression strategies, and the Emotion Regulation Profile – Revised (ERP-R) used vignettes to assess intentional response to situations. For the first aim, there was limited evidence that flourishers utilise higher levels of functional/adaptive, but substantive evidence that they use lower levels of dysfunctional/maladaptive ER strategies. For the second aim, flourishing was associated with these ER strategies over-and-above being free of pathology. The findings highlight a nuanced understanding of the ER of flourishers; flourishers appear to limit their use of dysfunctional/maladaptive strategies and do not necessarily report increased use of functional/adaptive strategies. Implications for wellbeing research and clinical practice are discussed.

Emotion regulation strategies can be grouped into two broad categories:

Antecedent-focused strategies (used before an emotion fully arises)

Response-focused strategies (used after an emotion has already started)

Antecedent‑Focused Strategies
(aimed at preventing or modifying emotional responses early)

Situation selection
Choosing to approach or avoid situations based on their likely emotional impact

Situation modification
Changing aspects of a situation to alter its emotional effect

Attentional deployment
Redirecting focus—e.g. distract yourself from distressing thoughts

Cognitive change (reappraisal)
Reinterpreting a situation to change its emotional meaning—e.g. "this is temporary"
