"Been on both sides of a breakup now, here’s what I’ve realized.","Two weeks ago I ended a nearly 2 year relationship. It hit me that I’ve now been on both sides of a breakup and I’ve learned a lot.

About two years ago I got dumped. Looking back, I could tell she was slowly losing attraction for me but I was naive. We stopped having sex for months and I didn’t see the writing on the wall. It hurt like hell when it ended. I felt blindsided, rejected, and crushed.

Now in this recent relationship, I was the one who slowly lost attraction. I ended things and it completely blindsided her. She was like a golden retriever. Sweet, loyal, and full of love. She had no idea it was coming. Watching her break down was brutal. I cared about her, just not in that way anymore.

I won’t lie, being the one to end it was hard. It messed with my head. But to be real, it was nowhere near as painful as being dumped. I don’t know how people pretend they’re the same. They’re not.

Still, breakups suck in any role. You’re separating from someone you once loved, someone you shared your life with. That grief is real.

But here’s the thing I keep coming back to.
We all only get one life.
We will all die one day.
This pain we feel right now is temporary.
It’s heavy, but it’s not forever.

And if we really think about it, how can we blame someone for leaving if they’re unhappy? Yes, it hurts. Yes, it feels personal. But they didn’t choose who they are or who they’re drawn to. None of us did. A lot of it comes down to genetics, brain chemistry, timing, emotional baggage, things we don’t control.

In a different life, maybe you had better genes or more charisma and that person would have stayed. Maybe you’d be perfect for them. But you didn’t get that life. And that’s painful. But it doesn’t mean you’re unlovable. It just means they weren’t your person.

I wish we could all carry this awareness. I wish it could protect us from the pain. But heartbreak isn’t logical. It’s emotional. And feeling it is part of being human.

Just got dumped 2 days ago and the pain and grief is unimaginable. She lost interest in me. I was blindsided but looking back i do see signs. I just chose to look away cause the rest of our lives are so good. Being dumped is painful but I know this too shall pass. Very thankful for this group and all the support. ||| I feel it hard bro. Got dumped a couple days ago and it's been real hard. You're right about not being able to blame her. She told me she wasn't in love with me anymore  and that hurt me so fucking badly because I am madly in love with her. I can't blame her tho, can't pretend like it would be right for me to beg her to stay. It's not right for my own health. But fuck man I miss her so much. Day by day. ||| If only the one who dumped me would just admit they did it because they lost attraction or something like that. Instead they go on and on about how they wanted me to find happiness and find someone better. That they didn’t want things to end but they did it for me. I hate hearing that damn excuse. It would give me peace if they stopped acting like a savior.. ||| There is a lot to unpack here. I feel quite different from you on a number of things. I'll try and be brief, and I'll chunk it out for clarity.   >This pain we feel right now is temporary. It’s heavy, but it’s not forever.  No, the _pain_ is not forever. But, barring psychotherapy, the _effects of emotional trauma_ very much are. We stop missing the one who left us relatively not long after their departure. But trauma from a breakup is akin to the death of a loved one, with the added pain of personal judgment and rejection. I have experienced four breakups from LTRs in my lifetime (2-7 years each). I have never attended psychotherapy sessions. I can tell you with absolute certainty that the effects of trauma from every one of those breakups still influence my perception of the world, of people, and of myself, even the first one over twenty years ago. By all accounts, these breakups had mostly undesirable impacts on my personality. Moreover, the effects seem to be cumulative, magnifying existing effects from previous experiences.   I mention this because the subtext of your post seems to be that breakups come free of cost. Nothing could be further from the truth. Breakups come with some of the most damning emotional costs in life. We need to be more aware of these costs as a society.   > And if we really think about it, how can we blame someone for leaving if they’re unhappy? Yes, it hurts. Yes, it feels personal.   Breakups are exceedingly personal. Few things in life are more personal. It is a referendum on you as an individual, the whole package, that essentially says, ""You are no longer of the quality I require in a partner. I choose to go find a different partner to replace you who meets the standard(s) you do not.""   If that isn't personal, nothing is. Even if it's a matter of personal preference, that is still one more person in the world who does not value what you can provide as a partner - despite them being the only person whose values matter to you. To feel absolutely lesser as a result is 100% expected.   >In a different life, maybe you had better genes or more charisma and that person would have stayed. Maybe you’d be perfect for them.  My point exactly. You're just not good enough.   >I wish we could all carry this awareness. I wish it could protect us from the pain.  This awareness absolutely protects us from the pain, albeit at the cost of limiting us to a mediocre life. By abstaining from intimate relationships with emotional investments, we are guaranteed never to experience that pain ever again. However, most people are unwilling to choose that option presumably due to the intense payoff a successful, loving relationship can provide (according to pop culture, at least).   As we advance through life, we become increasingly aware that that ""successful, loving relationship"" is largely a manufactured pipe dream rather than objective reality. As a result, we opt for the painless mediocre existences. And, although I will admittedly never be happy, I also will never experience sadness on that level again. There is comfort in that. ||| I'm taking umbrage with you placing the blame here on genes or lack of charisma. That sounds like projection and passivity to me. Also, you knew how horrific the pain of being the dumpee yet you decided to do that to someone else? A relationship of nearly 2 years is very serious and if you were unhappy for whatever reason, you should have just communicated that first instead of making a unilateral decision and blindsiding your person. Giant red flag. ||| I don't necessarily agree. If a breakup is blindsiding someone, then there wasn't enough communication. If you ever want a relationship to last, you can't rely on attraction lasting forever. After the first falling in love, staying in love is a decision and work. That doesn't mean it will always work out, but there should be a conscious effort towards it. Relationships are not magic.  If you realize something isn't working for you, bring it up. Communicate and see if it can work on it together. And if it doesn't work, the breakup isn't a surprise. ||| >And if we really think about it, how can we blame someone for leaving if they’re unhappy?   I don't blame someone for leaving if they're unhappy. I blame someone for not making that unhappiness clear. Not a subtle sign that I'm supposed to pick up through special signals, but directly communicating your displeasure with the relationship.   Is that hard? Yeah. Can the person still choose to ignore that or override it? Yeah. But that's your truth and it's better to tell it than sneak out of the relationship before it's over like a thief. That's immature and unfair, especially if you claim to care about the other person at all. ||| Honestly, losing attraction is easily one of the common obstacles of any relationship, and being distant/ emotionally withdrawing/ disengaging from a relationship is also a common behaviour. The difference is that some people try to understand what causes them to behave like that, and most of the time, the self reflection leads to growth and a better and more fulfilling relationship. If your response is, “it’s not that complicated, I just fell out of love”, then I think it’s just proving my point. Your post, to highlight how a dumper feels, is kinda pitiful. If you lack such emotional maturity, it does seem better for the girl you dumped since on the surface, the likelihood of all your subsequent relationships working out long term is very low. ||| People need to understand that attraction is also a temporary thing. Any thing new is more attractive, we just started having a consumer mindset towards everything in life. Easier to replace. ||| I don't think people usually blame someone for leaving because of being unhappy.  No one blames them for the choice to break up, but the way they do it.   Most people are afraid and do not have the courage to do so in a humane and respectful way, So they choose the ""easy way out"" - To disappear or to discard in the most painful way.   I can tell you from my personal experience: My (now) ex decided all of a sudden to stop answering my texts and just blocked me when I tried to understand what's going on. A couple of days prior, she sent me the most loving letter for my birthday....So.... You know?   And you're right, they don't choose who they are or who they're drawn to, but they ARE choosing how to end things."
I saw my ex with his new gf,"I broke up with him on May 2nd. By June 6th he was in another relationship. We were together 4.5 years. 
I was hurt by hearing this. 
But then I saw them together. I can’t get over it. I can’t get how he moved on so quickly. 
I was fine until I saw them together. Now I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. It’s all I think about. 
I wonder if they were talking before we were over. He was so distant with me before I ended it. There was a disconnect. 
Was she that reason? 
I saw her, she’s not even attractive. ",21,32,2025-06-30 14:21:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo8sr6/i_saw_my_ex_with_his_new_gf/,,,"You broke up with him. Did you also want him to be miserable as long as you deemed necessary? Don’t do that to you. Own your decision, which was probably correct, and assume this could happen. She’s probably a rebound just out of spite. And in any case, it just doesn’t matter now. ||| I’ve been there, watched my ex move on fast, with the guy she cheated on me with nonetheless, even smearing me to justify it. It hurts, but it’s also clarity: he's her problem now, not yours. Focus on becoming the best version of yourself, one day you’ll thank this heartbreak for removing who was never truly for you. ||| It's called a rebound. It's for people who can't face the pain and went on to find someone cheaper and easier. The relationship is built on sand, inevitably failing in the future.  For those who suppress the pain, it'll catch up eventually.  Just make sure you do the right thing and heal. ||| i think tbh it is something you get over with time, you will find someone else but do it when you build that independent and establish what you want from a relationship. i think maybe the love died out for him, maybe he felt stuck. maybe you did too. most people aren’t worth the pain you feel inside, especially when they cause it. i think in a few months you will look back and be like thank god. you saved yourself from a failing relationship lowkey. give yourself grace, be kind to yourself. try and block it out, delete pics, messages, unfollow from socials. maybe you need to disappear for awhile until you feel yourself again. i think in relationships like that you get so attached and codependent on your partner it makes it difficult to detach and see yourself for what you are now. a lot can change in 5 years. this is a good thing actually, cause now you can discover a whole new person that has been waiting for you. he doesnt have access to that anymore, or he shouldnt. him moving on so quick is such a red flag. he doesnt and didnt give a fuck, even if its a rebound which is most likely what that is. people do that to get over people, but end up fucking themselves over in the process so W for you honestly. if he wasnt serious about a 5 year relationship, how is this girl any different. we should pity her lowkey. i think some things are better left unknown yk? you speculate he was talking to her before you  left? who gives a shit, he aint worth a damn. you deserve better tbh. you will love being single after awhile. i promise, time heals most things and i think that is what you need. time. ||| I know how you are feeling. The exact same thing happened with me and my ex. He told me for 3-4 months that he wasn't ready for a relationship and he was depressed before he broke up with me (4 yr relationship). And then I see a pic of him on a holiday in Bangkok with a new girl just 4 months after our breakup. Im convinced that was cheating, if not physically then at least had a girl lined up for after he ended things with me.   All my sadness turned to rage. Was I crying, down in the dumps for this guy? Im so relieved that I didnt end up with him. I know exactly what you are going through. Give it a couple of weeks. Cry if you want, but be glad you aren't with such a person anymore. If they do this to you, they will do it to the next girl too. Pity the girl whom he is with and move on.  I remember the day I saw those pics. That's the day I deleted all the photos of him in my phone and got the courage to block his number. It felt good. Finally I had my clarity. I had my peace. Think of this as the best thing that can happen to you. Now you know that it meant next to nothing to him. He wasn't crying on the bathroom floor, he was out there looking for the next victim.  Trash takes itself out every single time. Believe in that. ||| In my opinion, the pain you’re feeling right now has less to do with him and more to do with your nervous system crashing from withdrawal. You spent 4.5 years emotionally tethered to someone. That’s a psychological bond, and when that bond breaks, your brain doesn’t just “get over it.” It panics. It scrambles for answers. This is grief, not proof that he was better than you or that she’s somehow a threat. And listen, I’ve been there. I remember seeing an ex with someone new and feeling like I got hit by a truck. I spiraled. Couldn’t eat. Couldn’t think straight. I stared at the ceiling every night replaying what I thought I missed. And just like you, I saw the person and thought, Really? That’s who you upgraded to? But let me tell you what I learned: it wasn’t about the new partner he was dating. It wasn’t even about HIM. It was about my ego.  When someone moves on fast, your brain screams, Was I that easy to replace? But it’s not always love they’re chasing. Sometimes it’s just a distraction. It’s called rebound validation. Thats a cute way for describing someone who rushes to attach to someone else to avoid sitting in the discomfort of the breakup. Studies show rebound relationships that happen within 6 weeks are almost never rooted in genuine connection. They’re a way to avoid healing. That’s not a win. That’s emotional running. And yeah, he was probably talking to her before you broke up. Let’s be mad real. When a man is distant, detached, and suddenly “in love” a month later, 9 times out of 10, he was prepping his exit. That’s not love. That’s cowardice in a cute little disguise.  You said you were doing fine until you saw them. That means your HEALING was happening. What you’re feeling now is shock, not relapse. You’re shaken, not broken. Let yourself cry, but don’t let this man convince you that you were less than. You left. He pivoted. And now you get to rebuild a life that doesn’t require you to chase someone to feel seen. You keep wondering why he moved on so fast. The better question is: why are you trying to make sense of someone who didn’t honor what you built? Between now and dead, you really gonna keep watching his storyline or start writing your own again?  I wouldn’t give that kind of power to someone I had to let go. Not anymore. ||| she’s probably a rebound or just someone he’s using out of spite. don’t think too much into it, if anything it says a lot about his character. be glad you’re out of it, if that’s the kind of person he is. i really struggled with finding out my ex of 2 years had a new girlfriend within 3 weeks, but at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter. he truly didn’t care for the relationship and that’s okay, he’ll likely never care for someone until he looks inwards and stays single and works on himself. people like your ex, mine, and everyone else’s who rebounds are very sad and insecure people. we can’t change them and it’s okay. you just have to accept it and pick yourself up and slowly rebuild the right way. know that you are healing the right way and that you will come out better. ||| I can say he’s probably dating her as a distraction from the pain, but why breakup with him if u still have feelings for him, yall could of fixed the problems u had or communicated better to fix stuff instead of a breakup ||| He didnt move on fast, she was there all along. Praying for you and pls focus on yourself and heal. ||| If shes not even that attractive and judging by how quick it happened, he's probably just using her to get over you. Post a really hot photo of yourself, maybe he may talk to you again, maybe you guys can rekindle, who knows"
Didn’t think losing someone who was already distant would hurt this much,"We hadn’t really been ""us"" for a while. The texts got shorter, the calls less frequent, and the silence between us started feeling louder than the words. Still, when we finally ended it, it hit me like a punch I wasn’t ready for.

It’s strange how you can miss someone who stopped showing up long ago. I keep replaying moments that felt small back then but now feel like signs I ignored. The way they started pulling away. The way I tried harder when I should’ve let go.

I’m not here for pity I just needed to say it out loud. To someone. To anyone.",22,5,2025-06-30 13:40:12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo7svo/didnt_think_losing_someone_who_was_already/,,,"ha, i'm there with you. i feel it all as well. truly unbelievable, it hurts so bad. we knew it was coming, we were just holding on so tight trying to salvage it and make it better like it was! ||| It’s often hope that kept us there, and it takes a long time for hope to go away, even after breakup. ||| I just convinced myself it was nothing, that she had been distant before and that passed and so will this. That if there was any major issues she would talk about it (even though we were both shit at communicating). And if she was thinking of leaving, she wouldn't still show me affection and say ""i love you"" right? Yet my anxiety was growing and when she randomly came to my place that day I knew what was gonna happen.   Still the worst pain of my life. ||| that’s the grief of *hope* dying   not the person   the part of you that kept showing up even when they didn’t   and yeah, that hurts like hell   but now you get to stop auditioning   you get to let silence be peace instead of punishment   you said it out loud   now go live like you meant it ||| It's because you also realize that something, or rather many somethings were ignored or disregarded before that point, which led to that point. I begged my ex to work on things with me, and tried talking to him about things when they were barely forming issues. If you work on things when they barely show the potential for forming cracks,  you can keep a healthy relationship. Communication is everything. My ex was the everything everything is perfectly fine, hates talking about anything even remotely difficult type. So cracks formed, then grew and grew as my feelings and our issues were constantly dismissed, ignored, and pushed aside. Our connection weakened and I inevitably grew distant, felt hurt and troubled by his behavior patterns. Then he acted blindsided when I wanted to end it, but he'd been told of every issue that I'd been single-handedly trying to fix and overcome. It takes two to keep a relationship healthy though and one can't correct the issues caused by the other partner. Hindsight hurts"
7 year relationship gone in an instant.,"I moved citys to live together and had our own apartment with two cats but now that is all gone in a instant.

I walked into our bedroom and found her naked in bed with a close friend of mine last night. She woke up and heard me enter the bedroom and, I walked back out and got into my car and drove 4 hours to my familys home going 150mph down the highway nearly the whole way. I'll have least 3 speeding tickets but my mental state was so gone that, I nearly drove my car into a tree on a country road last night as my suicide thoughts returned because of the stock as, I was completely numb to the point, I didn't even cry. 

It's been 12 hours since this and, I haven't slept a single bit. I have received 54 missed calls and 132 messages from her since last night so yeah. My life that, I once had completely fell apart last night of building a life for myself in a different city and we got the same social circle.

I turned 25 two days ago so thats my birthday surprise, I suppose. I have thought about, what to do next so ill do this...

I will go back to our place and get all my things so literally everything in the apartment when she is at work and get a moving truck for everything. I will contact my landlord to finish my tendency so she will have to leave the apartment in a couple days. I will take my cats also as, they are under my name and move back home to my parents house for the next couple months so i can rebuild my life from scratch again. 

After this, I will hit the gym hard to get as fit as possible over the next couple months to completely focus on my own development and try build a social circle once again.

I have gained nearly 50 pounds in the last 7 years so, I am completely out of shape so all this pain and hurt will be my motivation. I will not rebound nor speak to another girl until, I am ready for it and my life is on the right track and I have lost this weight that destroyed my own self confidence.

I suppose the outcome of this would be a massive redemption plan for myself so maybe one today, I can love the right person and be the true me once again as, I haven't been the real me in many years. I entered the relationship depressed and battling mental health like depression but, I won't let this beat me.

I will post a r/ glow-up in 6 months time so throw me a follow if you guys are interested in it because, I will achieve all my goals by then hopefully.

When they come back it’s never worth it.,"Post says it all. He came back after a few months, we met, had a good time, talked about making it work. Now I'm waking up to calls from him wanting to talk, him texting and keeping up with me, etc. but it feels empty. Too little too late tbh, even though he's the one who left. I wonder what chick rejected him for him to be back like this. Maybe it is real who knows? But I don't care anymore. Months of him getting happy talking to others, going out etc. without a word to me. I had to accept that to move on and now this?

AKA, reconciliation. It's such a bummer too because when they do come back it gets your hopes up but often it's just because they're seeking closure, unsure how they feel about you so they're testing the waters, or they just see you as a backup to get attention and validation from because they know you'll give it to them. Rarely they're trying to get back with you because they legit love you. ||| Things come to u either when u don’t need them or u forget about them🤣 ||| I completely agree with you.

"If they really loved you, you'll regret breaking up, forever. (1.5 years on)","I've been in therapy for a good 1.5 years now, and began therapy following breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years. Through therapy I have come to understand that the problems in the relationship were mostly with me and caused by me; I placed blame with her at the time and convinced myself that we were fundamentally incompatible. I treated her so badly, which I am ashamed of. I have never been loved by anyone in the way that she loved me. She supported me through real hardship, taking so much time and emotional energy to speak and listen to me day upon day, despite the kind of toll this must have taken. She cared her me so deeply, and showed this in so many big and little ways. She celebrated every victory of mine, showed so much encouragement and enthusiasm with everything I wanted to pursue. She was so beautiful that she would be complemented by strangers. She was so intelligent, a deep and critical thinker. She was completely committed and put everything into our relationship. She was my closest and dearest friend as well as my girlfriend.

After living together in a real apartment, our relationship was almost over. I criticised her daily, was passive aggressive and there were times I had shouted at her, called her names, told her I hated her. No matter what she showed up with love and understanding, making every effort to solve the problems I was bringing up to her. I am so ashamed. At the time I blamed her for being the one that was I the wrong, that she was disrespectful and immature... anything to avoid accountability. We stayed together, we moved out of our apartment and ended up being long distance because of our careers, yet I allowed this to become the final reason as to why I should call it quits, despite that there was a clear vision for when the long distance would end. 

When we broke up I was back dating straight away. She was the problem after all and I didn't care. Or, at least I thought so. 3 months later it hit me like a bus, I had lost the most special and wonderful person I had ever met. Not only that, I really hurt a person who had shown constant love and care for me. I lost something that I don't believe I will ever find again (I haven't yet, I've had a few short term flings that go nowhere...and nobody comes close, or ever will, come close to her)

I don't have the words to express the regret I feel for losing her. She is in a new relationship now and very happy. I would give anything to go back and reverse my decision and make up for the pain I caused.

I hope you never do that to a girl or anyone u love again. ||| I haven’t read a story on Reddit that is more similar to mine. Pretty much word for word, but I was with her for 7.5 years and threw my entire life away over the phone at the age of 30 when I was frustrated with her. It’s been a year now and the raw grief is here to stay with me for the rest of my life. ||| Wow. This sounds so much like my ex. I hope he'll be feeling this in a few months/years.

Most people just go on blaming the other without doing the necessary internal work and taking accountability.   We’ve all made mistakes, we’re human. Forgive yourself and take these as lessons to not repeat. ||| Thank you for your honest and real vulnerability. I’m sorry you learned this lesson this way. If it brings you any comfort, it’s been a year after being with my partner for 3. He blindsided me with a break up and blamed everything on me (I had too many plants, my dresser was too small)and it was devastating. I also supported him and encouraged him through a difficult time in his life.   I would always consider reconnecting with him if he was actively working on himself. ||| This is why I’m scared of men, I had an ex like you. He acted this way.

I feel like I have been told them at times, a piece here and there… but 10 months later and I don’t know if he’s convinced himself of a masterful delusion he created to leave or realized the objective truth. Not because I was perfect but because I tried my hardest to be no matter how long I was met with so much less.   I wish you the best, and that maybe someday you two will find your way back to one another when you’re ready to love each other well.  Living with that kind of loss really sucks… if she loved you the way I love my ex who left me, maybe she yearns for you still. Or maybe she’s stronger than me. Idk.

Only way getting back together will work,"I genuinely believe if two people get back together, for it to work they both needed to have gone through the grief and heartbreak of it, and move on as their own individual. Couples who are on and off and breakup but aren’t really broken up and don’t do anything beneficial during the time are not going to last. The only chance at reconciliation is if both people have moved on and grown a lot, and then have a brand new fresh start, not a pickup of where it left off. ",83,16,2025-06-30 00:47:41,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnuehl/only_way_getting_back_together_will_work/,,,"Agreed. I think if both people took the time to really have a hard look at themselves and change the parts of themselves they know contributed to the failure of the relationship, it's possible. But that's the only way it'd ever work. You both have to come back different people and both willing to reconcile and admit fault for where they screwed up. Too often do I see people pin 100% of the relationship failing on their partner, which is just straight narcissism. It takes both parties to make it fail.  If they got with someone else afterwards though, it's going to be much tougher to reconcile (not impossible but not likely)... there will probably always be some level of resentment knowing they were with someone else instead of taking the time to heal and feel the emotions of losing the relationship. More often than not, when they come back after being with someone else it's not because they actually cared about you or really loved you, they just want to see if they still have you on the leash. Rarely they come back for true reconciliation and a desire to put in effort. ||| And how long does it take? ||| It can work if you both are willing to reconcile and start fresh. My ex and I of 5 years, met up post break up, 6 months later and we have been trying to see if we can give our relationship a 2nd chance. We both are working on our individual self’s so it’s a very slow process. We’ve been dating each other for past 2 months. We text during week when we’re free and hang out every other weekend. So it can happen if both of you are mature emotionally. I have forgiven my ex in hopes that he has forgiven me for breaking up. I was mentally not in the right headspace 8 months ago when I ended things with him. ||| This gives me hope and I wish I can send this to him. I’m so hopeful that we will get back together, but maybe I’m naive and delusional. ||| The best partner after your ex THAT YOU LOVED, is your ex that has grown. you restart. you build. feelings cant really be changed but mistakes are here to build on them. ||| If they were genuinely working on themselves, learning,  growing, and healing then yes I think so. However, if one were in a relationship or dating around or just sleeping around, then I'd say no. They'd be adding new baggage and there would be no point in putting that on the old partner in a new attempt. ||| as much as this would be nice to believe, it won’t happen for me. he got a rebound relationship within 3 weeks after being with me for 2 years, he also emotionally manipulated me beyond belief. even if he changed and processed the grief, i don’t think i could ever trust him again. the way he acted after the breakup truly showed me a side of him that i don’t think i could get past. even the way he treated me when he was with me, it’s hard to come back from. getting back with him would just undo all the hard work i have done to heal and find myself again. the only reason he would come back is because his rebound fails or he has a brain snap one day and realises that he fucked up. even then, his personality is like that of a narcissist, he’s most definitely an avoidant type, so even if he did realise what he’s lost, he’s unlikely to come back and admit it. i find peace in knowing that i tried and that i loved him. it’s okay that he likely won’t come back. ||| Hope so :c ||| This is the way, if it's got any chance to work. Can't rebuild. Have to build new and leave all the old designs in the past."

Agreeing to meet up with my ex was the worst idea ever,"We broke up 4 months ago and she messaged me a week ago wondering if I was down to meet up. Me, thinking I was healed and ready for any outcome agreed.

Well, we just met up, we caught up, and I asked her why we were meeting up? She said that she wanted to meet up to let me go, for closure. I asked her did she really just tell me this 4 months later to say this? She went quiet, I felt bad because I still love her. When we hugged, the flood waves of emotions came back and we held each other for like 2 solid minutes. She started crying and saying that she still loves me and she’s afraid she will never love anyone else like this. 

Well I’m just confused, why did she do this when we pretty much had no contact for 4 months? Also why does she still not want to rekindle despite saying all of that?

EDIT: So we are texting a bit the next day, nothing emotional, just kinda talking about our day and random stuff. I do think she is open to rekindling, and just isn’t sure. I know many people here have been/and are currently hurting; I am too. I see the stigmatization of dating in the modern world, that exes should remain exes etc. but call me naive, or dumb, or both; idc, I am going to follow my heart on this one and try to win her back. Because if you love something, why not go after it? Thank you all.

Sorry to hear you went through this. I know the feeling, and it really sucks. Do you feel that you still want her back or are you looking to let go of her? ||| Breakups are tough. It's not unusual for people to make illogical decisions during that time, driven by emotion. Who knows what was going through her mind.  I believe that love alone sometimes isn't enough to bring two people back together, as painful as that may sound. In my opinion, a healthy relationship needs more than ""just"" love + There were reasons why you broke up.  Yes, maybe one day you’ll meet again, once you’ve both worked on your issues, and who knows, maybe then you can give it another try. ||| I think it’s because she missed you. That’s it though. She missed you and doesn’t think that the relationship will work right now, will it “never work” no one can really know….  A lot of people seem to say that exes should always remain exes … I can’t say I disagree as someone who’s tried to “re-heat old soup” many, many times. ((Hugs))   also… I am a woman and I have done what she did … asked an ex to meet me but we’d usually be together again after, maybe even just have a great evening together but you’re just dragging out the pain If you aren’t really working on the problems.  I could be wrong but I think people are too impatient now with one another… I don’t think people in new relationships especially, want to work on anything… there’s too much promise in finding someone else.  It’s easier than ever now, just to meet someone but having a healthy relationship?? That’s pretty rare. ||| Dude don’t listen to all the hurting-projecting souls in the comments. There are always people in here to project their fears and pains onto other’s lives.  She’s not necessarily evil and controlling for doing this, lol. Just know that getting back with an ex isn’t easy, and can cause a lot more pain than just letting it go. ||| Some people can only meet you at the depths of which they’ve met themselves— she just hasn’t met herself in a capacity she’s okay with, we all make mistakes and playing your cards and acting authentically showing who you are will always mean more than being enough for another whom cannot meet themselves where you’re at. Take your time and understand you deserve someone who can meet you where you need to be met. ||| Idk I personally think it her initial plan of giving you closure although dumb to do is what her plan was but seeing you completely backfired for her and now she is going to miss you even more so there is that but as for you just keep living  life make her offer something concrete and if she asks to meet again say I am willing to but I want to make sure we are on the same page and try to figure out her reasoning for meeting up before hand ||| She said what she said because she is dumb and feels guilty for starting this in the first place.  Do you when your internal dialogue tells you it’s a bad idea, you know it’s a bad idea, your gut tells you it’s a bad idea, and you do it anyway?  That’s her.  And her being nice and telling how much she loves you is just lip service to “ease the pain and “boost” your ego.  She’s out and about and it has nothing to do with you anymore.  Learn, heal, and don’t look back.  The last thing you want for you is be a doormat. ||| I think she reached out because she still doesn't know how she feels.  Even if she has love for you and misses you, her saying she doesn't want to be with you says a lot.  If you want to rekindle things, you can reach out and ask what she's been thinking and why she doesn't want to get back together.  I don't think we ever stop loving someone, but we have to recognize if we are what's best for the other.  I hope everything goes well, and I'm sorry she's putting you through this. ||| That's the oxytocin addiction. We're chemically wired to people we've bonded with and after a long time apart, even if it was for the right reasons, the biochemical side of us lights up like a pinball machine. This can often result in regretful actions or prolong the breakup process. ||| I am going through the same thing right now.  GF broke up because we got in a cycle of arguments - we never worked to resolve them.  She got fed up.  At the break-up convo I explained how this threat of losing her has helped give me a lot of clarity and that I think we can do better - she said it's final.  Two weeks into no contact she started sending Snapchats before bed.  Then came to visit me at work - then called me because she was having a ton of anxiety and needed help.  She misses me so much, she loves me, this is so hard.  But I am not hearing why would she be doing this - it is driving me crazy as I work on myself and would love nothing more than to work on this together."

"my mind is my biggest enemy, not my ex (unfortunately). 14 months post breakup","my ex (m) broke up with me (f) nearly a year and two months ago out of the blue with barely any warning signs. relationship was only 4 months long. i haven't seen him in a year, haven't contacted him in half a year (broke no contact for his birthday and trying to seek closure, to no avail). blocked him on everything because the thought of seeing what he looks like now could send me into a panic attack. 

i've had panic attacks periodically throughout the last year all triggered by reminders of him. i still feel like he haunts me and everything i do and everyone i talk to. 

he has a new (not even new, they've now been dating for longer than we ever had) girlfriend. moved on with life of course like what a normal healthy person should do.

i try every single day to get over it. regular therapy and meds (had anxiety attacks and insomnia bc my mind would constantly bring up thoughts about him leading me to spiral) and everything. it's been like this for the last year. 

it's gotten to a point where my mind has developed a new coping mechanism (delusion) to make sense of all these overwhelming thoughts: part of me believes that he'll come back some day. by all logic i know this isn't true and it isn't healthy, but in the depth of my suffering my brain can only supply this logic to numb the pain, even if it's delusional. 

i think deep down i still believe that things must make sense. that this suffering must mean something, about to something, conclude with something. while i know that the healthy, healed answer to this should be that this entire breakup saga should mold me into a new and healed person, with deeper insights into myself, the other part of me can't help but think of the what ifs and the hypotheticals. i know this journey of healing is something that i must deal with on my own but part of me sees my past year of failures and thinks that that must mean one thing: he has to come back for me to heal.

it's made me feel worse overtime. a year and two months have passed and by now i /should/ be over it. and yet it still haunts me so deeply and drives me to the most delusional insane mind spaces that i never thought i would be in. i want to say that i hope he's happy and living life healthily but i can't help but feel resentful that he is allowed to move on normally while im stuck here, 14 months later.

advice: if you get under new people to get over them,"from someone who has always moved on quickly, even when unhealed, this is the worst thing you can possibly do. 

i’m almost three months post breakup and i’ve had my fair share of situationships, dates, and hook ups. but even when it seems to work for a few days, the texts will dry up, the sparks will fade, and the realization always catches up. 

don’t talk to other people to get the attention you want or the intimacy you need replaced. it will always come back to get you. work on yourself and don’t focus on what your ex is doing or if they’ve moved on. it’s not a competition to see who moves on first or who’s happier post breakup. the real test is who’s in a healthier mindset with themselves, and don’t let them get the best of you.

It's disrespectful to yourself and to the other person to try to use them to get over someone. But i can say going out and talking to people can be helpful. I've met a few people who have been looking for connections that weren't sexual or romantic, and while it doesn't always lead to new friends, it is nice to get out. It's honestly been really pleasant meeting new people who share similar hobbies or new hobbies. ||| That is true. I used to do that a lot and let me tell you that it is not a nice feeling to feel. Each situationship, flings or a new relationship will always end in pain if you haven't completely moved on. I just think that if you haven't fully moved on from that one person then you shouldn't involve yourself with anyone else just yet because it's either you'll hurt the person or you'll hurt yourself more.

I’ll give you an example with my situation.   When we broke up, we tried to remain friends and everything was normal.

I then realized she unfollowed me too. As I use IG as a escape valve. I love taking pics and some of the pics I took after our BU and some of the texts accompanying them were more or less related to the breakup or my new situation. So I decided to block her there because I felt more free to publish whatever I wanted if I knew she couldn’t see it. Also removed her friends from my followers. I did not block her on whatsapp, but I ended up deleting her number, so I’m not tempted to write.   So it depends on the moment and the platform.

The relationship was likely trauma-bonded and codependent. In these relationships both parties become reliant on each other for emotional wellbeing and getting through the day. Now that he's gone you lost a part of your identity and learning to live without him is tough. He probably does miss you and your company but he probably is too emotionally immature to be able to sit with his feelings and confront things with you, so that's why he ran after you reached out... he was overwhelmed and shutting down is his way to cope.  Relationships with avoidants who have unhealed childhood trauma (or trauma in general, like cheating) are exhausting. They're not bad people but they have a lot of work to go through first. You're likely the anxious partner (reaching out first even though he dumped you) and you're going to have to learn how to re-center your life around you again. Try new things that you won't associate with your ex. If it's been a year then likely you're still holding out some kind of hope or checking his socials and that's preventing you from moving on.

I’m in a similar boat to you and I know, these thoughts can feel very consuming.

"Still love my ex, but her dad died shortly after we reconnected — should I reach out again?","
I (23M) reconnected with my ex (22F) earlier this year. We’ve known each other since we were 16. I was her first boyfriend, her first everything. We dated in 2022 and broke up in January 2024. After I decided to breakup, we continued talking and seeing each other occasionally. This continued until March of this year. She decided we needed to move on. In April we met up and I told her I still loved her, and we had a long conversation about everything. The way the conversation went it seemed like we would have gotten back together. We both agreed if we had just talked about everything that was happening we’d still be together. It was bad timing with our final exams, and she said it hurt that she couldn’t give me the answer I wanted to hear right now. She agreed to think about everything until after our exams. 

But then, after 3 weeks, the day before I was going to ask her out, her father took his own life very unexpectedly. 

I didn’t pressure her — I went to the removal and funeral quietly. I posted her out a small care package just with her favourite sweets and she texted me a short thank you for it. About two weeks later, I texted her just asking if she wanted to go for a walk and a hot chocolate it was really just a low-pressure way to say I’m still here for her. She left the message on delivered. I haven’t reached out since — it’s been 6 weeks.

I’ve seen her out nearly every weekend since. She’s always with her brother and his friends or family, never with just her own close friends. She actively avoids any situation where we might talk or bump into each other. But at the moment her circle is so tight and I only think her mum knows that we were meeting up or had that conversation. It would be very hard for her to reach out to me, even if she wanted. She hasn’t made any effort to contact me, even though I know she’s active online. I’ve seen her out in a nightclub with her friends and family dancing so I know she’s able to go out. 

Here’s my dilemma:
I still love her. I don’t want to pressure her at all, especially after what she’s been through. But I’m stuck in limbo. Part of me says: if she’s able to go out clubbing, she’s also able to reply with a simple, kind message like “thanks, but I need time.” I feel like I’ve been ghosted, which hurts especially given our history. I know she’s going through something horrendous but at the same time, if your able to go out dancing with strangers your able to send a text back. It’s not like our last time talking it was a fight. It was me telling her I love her and want to be with her. 

So do I text her next week with something light like:
“Hey, just wanted to check in and see how you’re doing. Hope you’ve been holding up okay.”

Or do I wait a few more weeks and send something a bit more honest, like:
“Hey, I know it’s been a while. I’ve been giving you space, but I still feel the same way I did back in April. I just wanted to say that, and I hope you’re doing okay.”

I know most people will say just move on. I just want to be able to hold my head high and say I did everything I could for her and with respect. But most importantly, I want to leave the door open so she knows if in 6 months time or whatever she could reach out. I want her to know that I’m not moving on because of this tragic event unless she wants me to. 

Appreciate any perspective on this.

TL;DR I reconnected with my ex and her dad died tragically. I’m stuck in limbo not know what to do. Afraid to move on incase she still has feelings but can’t realise them, or if it’s over and she doesn’t care.

I don't think anybody can tell you how much to wait before moving on. That's your decision. It's also your decision if you want to keep texting her but chances are she does think about you every now and then and if she did not reach out until now she probably has a reason. You said both of you were talking about and wanted to get back toghether so it seems a bit weird that in more than a month she did not say anything, maybe she did not want to burned you with her loss idk.

I would send  one last text in which I reiterate my position and the fact that I'm there for support.

vent on using online dating to get over an ex,"for context my gf and i knew each other for 4 years as close friends and dated for 1.5, the relationship was for the most part great and had no real glaring issues, she was my best friend.

as time went on though some basic incompatibilities started to surface and we also just started growing a little distant. i often felt like my needs weren’t being met in terms of intimacy,  which led to a lot of problems on my end due to the lack of feeling truly close and wanted by her on top of my insecurities. we ended the relationship mutually after it kind of reached a boiling point for both of us.

we agreed to remain friends, which has proved to be very difficult but now we are at the stage where we’re going no contact for a while.

i miss her a tremendous amount and a week or two after the break up i started using dating apps,  to distract myself but i would constantly go back and forth between feeling guilty and deleting my account and deciding i need to move on and continuing to use them.

this is more so just a vent than a call for advice but i feel extremely guilty now for ‘moving on’ so quickly as she is in a way still in my life in some capacity even as a friend. i miss her a great deal but in my mind the relationship was over long before we actually ended things officially. i had a couple matches but when it came down to it, flirting with someone else kind of disgusted me — the moment i have actual time to think about what im doing, i feel disgusted with myself.

as much as i miss her and would like to distract myself i think it is best to just sit with the pain. for anyone else going through this; dating apps won’t really make you feel any better, only distract you for a while and then most likely make you feel worse.

Is it okay that my ex bf of 5 years started dating another girl only a month after a breakup,"Me and my ex broke up 2 months ago, I needed some time to be alone I didn’t know where our relationship was going. 
Sooo, it’s been 2 months of no contact. I believe that he loved me, and I feel like I betrayed him in a way, that I was confused and needed some time alone.
So yesterday we met, and I told him what I felt throughout that time
I feel awful, lost and empty. 
I don’t want any men, I was trying to go on a date 2 times. Guys that I went out with were cool, but I don’t want anyone. All I can do is think about my ex.
I told him all of that, I didn’t expect anything from him. But when he told me that he’s already trying to build a relationship with another girl just after a MONTH after a break up. 
Why do I feel like that? empty and depressed. But he doesn’t? 
He loved me and move on so quickly, how? Can someone tell me if it’s okay for a guy to move on so quickly? 
Thing is also, I told him that I need some time, and want to go to therapy to clear what’s on my mind. And left more than a half of my clothes in our(now his apartment) and he having sex in our apartment where my clothes everywhere???

"He says he still loves me, but slept with someone else right after we broke up. Do I give him another chance?","Hey everyone,

I really need some advice because I’m at a major crossroads and I have no idea which way to go.

This is gonna be a long post.

Here’s the backstory:

I was in a relationship with my ex for a year. It was one of those really healthy, solid relationships, tons of open communication, emotional support, no real fights, just really safe and good. The kind of relationship I always dreamed of but never really had until then.



About a month ago, he decided to break up with me. And honestly, the reasons were somewhat valid. I unintentionally triggered some deep emotional wounds of his, after he had (also unintentionally) triggered some of mine. Something just snapped between us. It felt like everything we had built, this strong foundation, just collapsed in an instant.



After the breakup, I tried to offer him support, to be there for him emotionally, without pressuring him or expecting anything. But he chose to walk away.

Meanwhile, I was absolutely wrecked, crying all the time, feeling like a stray dog left out in the rain, hoping every single day that he’d come back, that we could heal from this pain together, and come out stronger.



But instead of numbing the pain with distractions or rebound stuff, I chose to fully sit with it and feel it. I started going to therapy 3 times a week, just to really process everything and heal in a real way. I isolated myself completely, only started going out and talking to friends again a week ago. I was devastated.



Then, last week… he reached out.

He sent me these super emotional messages, saying he realized how much he still loves me, how he wants to come back, build a future together, that I’m his “everything”, all those big sweet words. For a second, it felt like my dream was coming true. I was happy again.



But in the days that followed, it was super hard to actually communicate. I think he was overwhelmed, and to be fair, we both went through something pretty intense.



Now comes the part that broke me.

4 days after our breakup, one of my close friends called me and said he saw my ex out with another woman and they were acting really close. My first thought was, “Nah, that must’ve been his sister or something.” He’s always been this super loyal, grounded guy. I even remember a conversation where he told me he’d never be able to date someone else just a few weeks after a breakup. So I didn’t believe it.



But that same friend called me 2 more times about similar sightings. And even then, I still held onto hope that it wasn’t him. I know. Delusional.



Fast forward to yesterday.

He finally admitted that, yeah, he did hook up with someone else. I don’t even know how to explain how that made me feel. I'm just so disappointed. So betrayed.

I know that technically we weren’t together anymore, so I shouldn't feel this hurt, but it was just 4 fucking days after our breakup. And it wasn’t just any breakup, it was painful, emotional, and raw. My whole body is rejecting this reality.



I get that sometimes people do stuff to escape pain when it gets too heavy. But I can’t stop asking myself:



Is that all I meant to you? Was that really love? Just 4 days?



And the worst part is, I have no way of knowing for sure if there wasn’t already something going on between them before we split. He says there wasn’t, but... how can I trust that?



I went from praying for him to come back every day… to now feeling like all the trust I had in him is shattered.

I never thought I’d be the kind of person to post something like this here and be that girl who asks people ""Should I forgive him?"", but… here I am.



I’m so confused and I really need some honest opinions.

What would you do if you were in my shoes?

How would you process this?

Would you give him another chance… or walk away with your dignity?



Sorry if this post is all over the place, I feel all over the place. My brain is a mess right now and I just really need some outside perspective.

I would have a hard time regaining my trust not because he slept with someone so soon, but because, as you correctly put it, I could never be sure if that meant there was something emotional going on between them before you even broke up.   Don’t rush into anything. Give yourself time. Even if you feel you want to get back together, give it time to see how you feel about that in the next weeks. Even if you decide to try again, please take it veeeeeery slowly and one small step at a time. And only if you’re sure you can trust him again Don’t try just to see if…  Good luck, anything you decide will be the correct decision. ||| I'm really sorry to hear that and you don't deserve getting betrayed like that. I really don't recommend going back to him because he just broke your trust completely and he just said that he still loves you and your ""everything"" to him and you cannot hide and ignore the fact that he slept with someone. It's time to move on with him and focus on your own life. Let him live with his own life bearing the consequences of losing you. I hope you're doing okay and I pray for your proper recovery. ||| In my opinion you shouldn't go back to him. I feel like he broke up with you to test the waters with this new girl, and only came back to you when he realised that he couldn't do better than you, or maybe it didn't work out with this girl.   You are entitled to feel horrible and be a mess. It's your right to be all over the place. This person hurt you. However, you must look up and trust that things happen for a reason and that there are better things set in store for you.   Don't go back to him. He does not deserve it. And I think that if you take him back, he will take it foregranted that you will always put up with bad behaviour, and will always take him back.   Stay strong and much love xx ||| Nope if he truly loved you he wouldn’t have slept with someone else never mind entertain another person even if it was after the breakup. That’s my viewpoint on it at least. Allow yourself and heal and move on girl trust me no matter how good you think the relationship was when you start healing you’ll see all the red flags and cracks you missed because you was in love. ||| On the one hand, you were broken up and he had every right to date anyone that he wanted.  On the other hand...... 1) he didn't tell you about it, and 2) the fact that it happened so soon after the breakup is a STRONG indication that he had been planning it long before the breakup.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't give him another chance. But he needs to start telling the truth if he wants to ever earn your trust again. ||| my heart really goes out for you. i’m so sorry. it’s so valid for you to feel betrayed.  together or not, him getting involved with someone else ahhh. i’m really not in a place to give you advice but all i can say is, put yourself first. i can imagine what you’re going through rn. please be gentle with yourself.  man all these comments make me wanna cry 😭 ||| No.. please don’t ||| This is really bad... You feel so hurt and think “was this ever real”??  Stay strong ||| I wouldn't go back, it was only 4 days after the relationship. Even if he wasn't actively thinking about you when he was around this new girl, he needs to realize what a slap in the face and how disrespectful that is to your guys' relationship. If you really care about someone you dumped, you're not going to hop into something that fast, you're going to give yourself time to process it. His actions show that he thinks you're easy to discard and replace.  The thing is he's back because he dumped you, thought he could find better, and finally realized he missed the connection you had. If it takes leaving me to try out other people only to realize I was better, then it just shows you never really cared enough in the first place. The only circumstance I'd say it's even possible is if it's like years down the line and he's really changed as a person. He knows you'll take him back so that's why he's back. Walk away with dignity. ||| you’re not heartbroken—you’re betrayed *and* heartbroken   those are different wounds, and they don’t heal the same way  this wasn’t “just a rebound”   this was him telling you he couldn’t handle the pain and instead of facing it, he ran straight into someone else   4 days isn’t processing   it’s replacing  you sat with the pain   you bled   you did the work   he bailed, then circled back when the adrenaline wore off  love is what you *do* when it’s hard   he had the chance to choose you in the wreckage   he chose escape   that’s not evil   but it’s not someone you build with  walk away with your dignity   not to punish him   but to protect the version of you who finally stopped begging for bare minimum  **The** [**NoFluffWisdom Newsletter**](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) has some raw, no-BS takes on betrayal, self-worth, and what love *actually* looks like under pressure—worth a peek"
I stalk him everyday,I think about him and his new girl having sex. I dream about him. He cheated on me with her and she knew. I get angrier and angrier everyday. I look at all his social medias. I genuinely cannot go a day without him being in my mind. I hate seeing him live a good life while I’m still struggling with mine. I am completely disgusted in myself. Even when I’m hanging out with my friends or on a FaceTime call I still have the strong urge to stalk. If don’t do it I get extreme anxiety and I feel like I’m going to throw up. I’ve seen some stuff with him and his girlfriend and he’s sent me them just to brag in my face so it’s not like seeing them together makes me sick anymore or makes my heart race. I think the only way for me to get out of this is suicide and if they stay together any longer I might kill myself. I know people say to be ok with being by myself but that was my first boyfriend and I’ve been by myself for most of my life. ,8,6,2025-06-30 08:29:13,Trigger Warning,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo28tb/i_stalk_him_everyday/,,,"Don't suicide calm down it's too much breakup hurts but u should not take wrong steps ||| Woah. Stop right there. Take a pause. Breathe!  You need to grieve this relationship. Cry as much as possible. Talk to your girlies about this relationship. Let everything out. EVERYTHING!  It is not easy as it looks. First heartbreak puts a lot of dent and it seems your self-esteem has been brutally sabotaged. Whatever was the case of end of relationship but that doesn't mean you should let it define you.  You are more than a relationship. You are a human with all the emotions.

Find something new that makes you enjoy reading , watching or socializing other people. Life is still beautiful please don't take it away. ||| A cheating man isn’t worth losing your life over girl. It’ll be ok. Matter of fact, no man is worth k*lling yourself for. ||| Focus on yourself, divert the energy into things you can do to make your life the best it’s ever been. I recently just went through a breakup of a toxic relationship that I thought was life ending. It was my first serious long term relationship and I thought I’d never stop thinking about them, they consumed my every thought from waking to sleep and even in my dreams. I still dream of her but it doesn’t really affect me much anymore.   Don’t even consider for a second ending your life, you have just been given the opportunity to create a new one. I’ve learnt that being single is the best gift, I felt the same as you, “I’ve been single most of my life and this was my one snippet of joy, now the relationship is over I’m back to being miserable and lonely.” But it doesn’t have to be that way. I started new hobbies, volunteering, quit my job, spoke to strangers, made new friends. Stuff I would never have done if I was in a relationship. You will realise your ex isn’t shit after you meet new and interesting people.  The more you focus on yourself and putting your energy into forming your own life with the things that make you happy you’ll start to realise you’re happier on your own. The rage might not completely ever go away but it will subside, you’ll experience moments of acceptance and peace. Him cheating reflects nothing on you, it is a complete reflection of them and the utter garbage they are.  My life is so interesting now that it’s not centered around a neglectful person. And yours doesn’t have to be centered around a cheating piece of shit. You’re better than that.   Use the rage to exercise, get your phone away from you, ask your family to hide it for periods of the day or night etc.  start a new hobby you’ve always thought about or even if it’s only the tiniest interest. Go to an event or a place you would never normally go. It will lead you somewhere to experience something new and develop yourself. ||| this pain is real and loud—don’t let anyone tell you otherwise   but stalking him is just pouring gasoline on the fire inside your head   the only way out isn’t in the past or through someone else’s happiness   it’s in *you* finding a reason to breathe again  get help now   call a hotline   text someone you trust   don’t wait for the spiral to get darker  you survived this far even when it felt impossible   you’re not alone   and this is the chapter where you take back control   not for him, not for anyone else—*for you*"
I miss you,"It has been almost 3 months since my girlfriend of 3 years left me for another guy. When people ask me if I miss you, I say of course I do, but not in the way you think I do. 

I miss what we were, what we had. I miss the memories we made in the past and the experience we were able to give and create with each other.

I miss the future that we could have had, the plans that played out in my head. The story where we traveled the world together, get married, settle down and have kids.

So when I say I miss you, it’s not the present day version you. I miss the version of you that woke up everyday choosing to love me for who I am, wanting to build a future with me.

For anyone thinking of going back to their exes…this is for you.,"Today, I had a massive crash out because I badly missed my ex and I wanted to get back together with him. I talked to chatgpt and it said that my desire to go back to my ex is only a temporary measure that my brain is seeking so that I could undo the pain that I am experiencing. 

I’ve been reflecting about my desire to go back to my ex and I suddenly thought of this:

“If I get back together with him, there’s a chance that we may breakup again like what happened with my first ex. That means I would have to go through this pain all over again. I don’t want to feel this pain ever again.”

My breakup with my second ex is by far the most painful experience I have ever endured in my life. I’m usually a very vindictive person but the pain I endured had me telling my best friends “I wouldn’t wish this pain on anyone else.” This pain is unimaginable, unbearable, and literally soul destroying. It seriously demotivates me and drags me down to the pits of hell. 

Although it’s hard to stop all thoughts of going back to my second ex, the thought of me going through this pain all over again helps me manage it. Even if I think of the many what ifs that we could do to make our relationship happier and better than before, there is still a possibility of breaking up again. I already broke up with my ex. Who’s to say that we won’t breakup again? 

Even if we did put more effort and we were able to last a few more months or years because of it, the reason why we broke up in the first place *may* still haunt us in the future. And when we breakup again, I imagine it’s going to hurt MORE than now. I don’t want to experience this pain ever again. It’s like I’m burning alive inside and out, and I can’t do anything to put out the fire. I don’t want to pour all this effort into moving on only for me to go back to my ex and experience this pain all over again.

I’m heartbroken and not because he is a toxic person,"He left me, 3 weeks ago due to his job and mental health. We had a tough time communicating the past few months, but he internalized everything. Through his actions I know he’s still in love with me and I very much am in love with him. I have always known he’s my person, and it’s not going to change. I have to try to give him space, but I’m struggling to do so. My anxiety is so bad, I want him to be happy and I know I have to take care of myself. I’m just in so much pain. So I’m not really wanting advice more than just needing to write this out. I can’t breathe and I’m doing everything in my power to accept it.

You moved on like it was easy. Maybe it was for you. But I’m still stuck in the moments that used to feel like forever.

What does he want!?,"He left me in the middle of the night - no warning - no hint he was unhappy.  We had been together almost 7 years and I thought we were happy.  But he left, blocked me for 2 weeks after initially saying we were going to be fine and I needed to have faith, and he has now been living with and building a life with a woman he had an affair with about 5 years ago.  

But he still says he loves me.  We spend time together - leftover time when she is at work.   He’s asked me to go on a work trip with him because he travels M-F and during the week he will text every day, yet he ignores me on weekends when he’s home.  

I keep getting the wound ripped open every time I find out he’s done something for her I was longing for him to do for me … every holiday … every milestone.   But I can’t walk away, and the times I’ve tried he’s done something, said something to make me stay.  

All of his stuff is still here after 3 months.   I know that he is not coming back.  That is not even on the table and it’s never even been suggested. I want my life back. I want my life with him back, but I know that’s not gonna happen and I don’t know how to move on or why he’s keeping me around. I wanna be the one to walk away and I’m so afraid that he’s gonna do it first and it’s gonna destroy me all over again.

I don’t even know why I’m posting this because it’s all my own fault. Anything happens to me after this.

Toxicity at it’s peak,So basically me & my ex broke up 2 months ago. Won’t get into the breakup much cuz it was a very random breakup & i didn’t see it coming he broke up w me saying i was v toxic. 2 days after the breakup he started texting other girls didn’t surprise me cuz he was always a fuckboy & put on a show that i changed for you bs. 14 days after the breakup he started texting the girl he once kissed while we were together it was just a 7 month relationship he cheated & yes i forgave i was too blind i still am to some extent.I texted his friends & sneaked w his childhood friend cuz i wasn’t in my senses & did stuff to get his attention. So basically i got to know that he met this girl literally at a cafe behind my home & i crashed out i told the girl some stuff about him for the 2nd time & she cut him off. Literally the day i told her a lot of drama happened & somehow i bumped into him at a cafe we met & we kissed so fucking weird right i know but it’s us idk. Then we have been in touch since then met a few times talked on calls he told me about his chicks i told him about guy my talking stage basically. Sometimes he talked really nicely & sometimes he wanted to stop being in touch. We had sex twice. He told me about this girl that told him i like you but i also like someone else i like 2 people at the same time. & idk somehow we talked less after the sex i confronted this to him that 3 days we didn’t talk much you just use me for sex he literally went crazy & said some mean stuff to me a lot of mean stuff. yeah i actually met my talking stage 10 mins after we had sex he said he didn’t like it but whatever. so the same night we went to this party & i saw him holding hands w a girl she’s the same girl i guess. & i crashed out the girl was pretty ugly so didn’t mind but i texted him that i expected the girl to be pretty atleast. He said she’s pretty & again that let’s not be in contact. So the v next day i was w my sister & her cat he bumped into us & called me that i want to meet your sisters cat so he met the cat & went i was beside him so he started saying stuff like now i will go home & watch reels & then i will talk to girls. I didnt react i walked towards then he shouted oh someone’s getting jealous. So what kind of behaviour & toxic bond is this i am really attached to him & i just keep finding ways to talk to him idk why even though i know it’s insane & toxic,2,0,2025-06-30 14:30:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo9006/toxicity_at_its_peak/,,,
Opinions on this,"Edit, I want to send this to my ex broke up 3 weeks ago and 2 weeks no contact  
  
Hey it’s been a while and I’ve just spent the last few weeks growing and thinking about a lot and I wanted to talk to you about something I found out I’m not looking to change your mind I understand and respect your decision but I also believe you deserve the full story and the clarity I’ve been given recently

I started therapy last week which led to a gp appointment and I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD which explained a lot and that combined with the realisation that I didn’t know how to love you the right way recently made everything make sense

I never meant to make you feel overwhelmed or smothered and I always loved you with everything I could but while that love was real a lot of my actions came from fear fear of losing you fear of not being enough instead of just being calm and loving you in a way that felt safe and steady and I’m working on that now not for you or us but for whatever comes next for me in life and that’s not an excuse because I know if I got help like I should’ve we could’ve probably worked through this together

Anyway like I said this isn’t to change your mind or reopen anything I debated sending it for over a week but I’m glad I did because I just didn’t want to keep it to myself and whatever happens I hope you’re doing okay and that you find peace and happiness and live without regret because that’s all I ever wanted for you",2,3,2025-06-30 14:28:47,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo8ytz/opinions_on_this/,,,"Very mature.

Outside of the blindside discard, he wasn’t mean after the breakup. 

It’s been 7 months almost, and I’m thinking of sending a sort of closure message. Summarized, I’ll say: thank you, I’m sorry, and your actions hurt me, but I’ve moved on and forgive you.

It seems he’s the one who should be writing and that you are actually looking for an excuse to contact. I’d rather not. It will reopen a wound that does not seem to have healed 100% yet.   Just my 2 cents. ||| No, you're not over it! Who do you think you're fooling? Move on with your life, you don’t need this outcome!!!!! ||| Very very bad idea. Please don't do it. If you have no intention of getting back, then don't . It might give him hope and it will ruin his moving on process. ||| Well it'd probably be a good idea to send it but minimize the conversation afterwards if there is one as much as possible. ||| Write the letter but don't send it. Then wait a week or two, then read what you wrote. Do you still feel exactly the same way? Then go ahead and send it. ||| I don't understand the Brain of people here, it's either you caught up in your ego and didn't try to fix your relationship and stupidly went no contact for 7 months and just now regretting cos you still feel like you could've done better. Just move on with your life cos you've already done that.  You thought no contact is a magical fix now you've been left disappointed.   Indefinite no contact is when you've tried everything possible to fix the relationship so the only thing left is to move on which I don't think will ever bring regret to you."
How do I move on when I don't know why it ended?,"Will try to make this long story short but me (M32) started dating a co-worker (M20) last year.

We worked together for 2 years and over the last year we became really close friends, I was in a relationship at the time and ended things with my ex partner, not because of my co-worker but because I realised I allowed myself to stay in an emotionally abusive relationship for way too long and finally found the strength to move on from that. 

Things were tough as I was living with my ex-partner at the time and having to find a new place to live etc was very stressful. My co-worker was always there for me and helped me with moving etc. Eventually I found the courage to ask him out on a date, I convienced myself that there was no way he was going to ever say yes, there was a big age gap, but as we spent more time together I realised I was falling for him so had to ask just to get it out of my mind, to my suprise he agreed to go on a date with me. 

We went on a date and started dating, few people at work caught us kissing in a club one night so all our over colleagues eventually found out, which was fine he had no issues with it. We have both never dated someone who we were really good friends with first and this was something we both experienced for the first time.

We dates for a few months and I was seeing him a lot at work and outside of work. He never told his parents about me, I asked if it was to do with the age gap and he told me it wasn't, even though we are both out to our families, his family don't always acknowledge it so it makes it harder for him to talk to his parents about it, which makes sense. 

Things seemed to be going really well and I was the happiest I've ever been, we didnt spend much time together in 2025, his grandma was taken to hospital early on in the year and ended up passing away, this was the first time his really dealt with grieve and was super close to his grandparents so I know this time was difficult for him So I gave him all the time and space he wanted, I would always check in just so he knew I was there if he needed me but I tried not to be too needy.

We never slept together during our time together, I think getting past the friends and co-workers thing was a little difficult for him as I certainly shown interest but was not something I needed to rush as we were enjoying getting to know eachother on a much deeper level. 

We did hook up on valentines day, and thats the last time I got to spend any time with him 1-on-1 so a part of me feels like that might have contributed to him ending things, even though he claims it wasn't. 

He ended things with me in March via a text saying that where he was in life he just didn't have the time or energy to put into a relationship and he felt it wasnt fair for me or him. (I knew he wouldnt have been able to do it in person knowing him, so as much as it hurt me him doing it via text, I do understand it)

Things were really hard at first as I obviously had to still work him with, we went from being really close friends at work to partners and I was always a little tactile with him at work so was hard to turn that off. 

Everyone we work with still thinks we are together because we still kinda act like we are and I also dont feel like its anyones business to know we aren't.

Fast foward a few months, end of May I asked him out again, he said things were just different and I asked him not to answer but to think about it properly and we'd talk about it soon. He admited that he missed me sometimes and he still really cared about me but things were just different, but he agreed to take time to think about everything we spoke about. I asked him for a kiss which he leaned in for, and then over the last month every time I've seen him, will always kiss him goodbye or ask for a cheeky kiss and he would always kiss me back. I am very aware that i was the one always initiating this but he also never pulled away or rejected me. This went on for a month as everytime I tried to talk to him about me and him he would avoid the situation and I suppose to some degree I was avoiding it too because I knew once we talked me kissing him would stop again and it's been nice being tactile with him again. 

When we spoke last week he said he still has a lot going on (I know quite a lot about the stuff going on with his family) but he said he also has stuff himself he needs to sort out. I told him there wasn't a single thing he could say that would make me change my feelings for him and that i still loved him, and that I'll always look out for him. We haven't spoken for a week as ive been off work, and kinda dreading going back to work as I'll have to see him which im looking foward too but also know it will be quite difficult as I am unable to turn my feelings off, there's still so much I want to ask him. But mainly, I just want to know why it ended.

He said I was one of the nicest guys he has ever met and that obviously he still cares a lot about me, but I don't know what to do moving foward. My biggest fear is that he will quit and then I'd never see him again. 

Sorry for long post, thought maybe getting some of this down might help.... Would love to know if anyone has ever navigated through something similar...",3,1,2025-06-30 11:50:15,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo5ha3/how_do_i_move_on_when_i_dont_know_why_it_ended/,,2 year(s),Well here's something I've been learning; if someone is a oh so nice person but ditches you out of nowhere; they're probably not a nice or cool person. He might just be using you for attention and that could be why he rejected your advances but was never intentional about keeping you which is probably why he never introduced you to his parents and just came up with an excuse. Before you move on& heal; you have to first process he wasn't the man you fell in love with. You deserve better.
She didn’t even care.,She said that she broke up with me because it felt weird for 3 days then she lost feelings over night. The issue is even if that’s true you would still be sad but she doesn’t even care that we are over it doesn’t affect her at all. I was bad I didn’t listen to something’s enough but she also had stuff that I needed to do better she never brought up.

pleaseee help me see what went wrong!!! i’m desperate.,"ok so i never thought id post on this subreddit but here i am lol, almost 3 weeks ago my bf of almost a year broke up w me over a google meet and i never saw it coming 😭😭 if anyone is willing to read all of this and help me understand what’s going on, i would be beyond thankful. 

here is some context - he basically wanted me for a year before we got together but i rejected him, then later on during the summer before our hs senior year we got together. our relationship was pretty much perfect for the first few months, we both have v similar interests so we literally led school clubs together and shared our classes. we are both pretty academically driven so it got competitive sometimes. i always did slightly better than him and while he’d tell me he’s proud of me/call me smart, i could tell it made him insecure. he said how he had imposter syndrome and never be proud of his achievements even tho i constantly told him how proud of him i was. so we’d get into arguments abt that sometimes, id help him a lot w his feelings about school but it got to a point where i told him it was ridiculous how he’d constantly put himself down and act like he’s failing when in reality he had one of the highest grades in our graduating class. i was still always there for him tho. that was one of our main issues, him being extremely insecure and comparing us. another thing we’d argue over a lot is politics (he’s a trump supporter, i despise trump) but we accepted that it’s ok to have diff political beliefs and it didn’t change the way we thought of each other, although it got frustrating at times. then there were arguments here and there abt personality differences, im a very emotional, expressive person and while he can be expressive too, he was more laid back and “nonchalant” during the relationship, ofc he still showed me love and always asked to see me/bought things for me but there were times where i would ask him to put in more effort when it came to showing affection and stuff like that. he understood and tried to change but that is just a personality thing he had which i also tried to accept. but arguments like that are normal and every time we always made up and acknowledged our faults and made things better. they became quite frequent at times but we would both talk things out and apologize and say we’d never want to leave each other. 

a month before our breakup, he told me that he had a porn addiction that he finally got over. he said he’s had it since a very young age and didn’t know how to tell me until he “prayed it away”, went to church, etc. i was obv quite devastated and reacted badly, and contemplated the relationship. it changed the way i viewed myself for a while and he knew that and wrote me paragraphs about how much he loves me and loves the way i look and he was sorry for lusting but he wants to marry me (and no sex before marriage), etc. i did admire that he had the courage to tell me abt his addiction, even tho he told me way too late into the relationship and told me during our final exams period 😭 i told him i forgive him, although it was evident that it negatively affected my perception of my body for a while after that. he did help me through it tho. after that, i would lash out at him more often bc i subconsciously tied everything to his addiction. not replying to me? maybe he’s watching porn (when he’s just playing video games). doesn’t put in enough effort? maybe it’s bc i don’t look like those girls (but he’d constantly tell me im the most beautiful woman and he didn’t care about the girls, only about watching the “act”). i talked to him abt the reason why i’ve been more emotional recently and apologized, and i said over time im trying to get over it. he understood me, we hugged it out and he told me it’s all gonna be ok, this was around a week before he left me. 

now before he left me - we are both intl students living in an expat country. we applied to the same unis so we could go together, but he always told me that if we went long distance, he’d never leave me. we both got into the uni he is going to in his home country and he begged me to go w him. i chose to go there and even paid the deposit. for a month, we thought we were gonna go together and we were rlly excited. however, my parents and i realized last minute that it’ll be way too expensive for me since im an intl student there (he pays domestic fees) and id be in a ton of debt after my degree. i’m already a citizen of a first world country with great education, so it was a no brainer for me to just complete my undergrad degree there which is much more affordable. i only planned to go to his country to be w him, and our countries are on opposite sides of the world. i had to break that news to him a week before we broke up, but he was constantly reassuring me and being v supportive. i cried to him abt how much id miss him and he told me he loves me sm and that “if we ever break up it wont be bc of distance”. 4 days before leaving me, he took me out and bought me stuff and comforted me and kept telling me its gonna be ok. the next day, he suddenly went all cold and asked to call me. on the call he started talking abt how he doesn’t know if he can put in the effort during long distance, he said he’s worried, he even went into “cultural/religious differences” between us (we’re only diff denominations of christianity, i don’t see the issue). i got worried and told him we can work it out, we would literally be apart for max 2-3 years (and i can still visit him multiple times a year) and then we could do our postgrad together. i could also do study abroad in his uni. i told him i loved him, for the first time ever he didn’t say it back. he continued to not say it back and i got rlly scared. he then told me he needs space to think abt everything and didn’t want to give me “false hope”. he took around 3 days, the night he said he needed space i almost had a panic attack at around 2am bc i was rlly scared. i didn’t know what else to do so i just called him. he picked up and he helped me breathe. he said “im here with you tonight” which worried me bc he made it seem like he wasn’t gonna be there for me after that. i cried and told him i need him and said i dont want to break up. told him i loved him, he still didn’t say it back. asked him if im still his gf, he didn’t respond. he told me he’s overwhelmed and it wasn’t fair for me to do this when he needed space, and he’ll talk to me soon. he hung up after he “heard that i was breathing better” while i was still saying his name trying to talk to him. i get he needed space, but i was so fucking worried about him leaving and wanted him to know how much i care for him and im willing to make anything work. i sent him messages on every social media i had him, telling him that whatever concerns he had abt us, we can sit down and talk it out. i sent photos of us telling him how cute we are and i never want to let that go. kept telling him i love him. this was all the next day. after sending all these messages, i realized i should stop and give him time. the day after, i started to get concerned bc we have never gone that long without talking before. i ended up writing him a 5,500 word email, attached photos of us, addressing everything. i named the subject “when you’re ready, please read this” and emphasized in the beginning that he doesn’t have to read it straight away bc i knew he wanted space. i then addressed everything to him, how we could make the distance work, how i can do study abroad w him, how i can still visit him throughout the year, how we are doing postgrad together. i told him i was willing to spend the money to see him and i was willing to sacrifice my sleep for him even if it meant he didn’t. i addressed the “religious differences” even said im willing to raise our children as the same denomination as him (that’s what he wanted). i apologized for being emotional/dramatic a lot and said “i’ll change” and we can sit down and discuss his concerns. i went into detail about absolutely everything and gave multiple realistic solutions, 5.5k words is not a joke. i sent the email. 

he messaged me the day after saying he’s ready to talk and wants to on a google meet. he said he read the email and he acknowledged all the messages i wrote to him on every app, saying he read it fully. he told me he read my email multiple times. we go on the call and i’m panicking, he starts by saying he doesn’t think we’re compatible and the relationship isn’t gonna work out. he talked about long distance, how he’s worried i put in more effort than he does. he even went on about cultural values which made no sense. he said it’s a problem w him and not w me. he said he doesn’t see flaws in me, but in himself. i told him that wasn’t true and just blamed myself for everything so he could stay w me. he said he can’t “emotionally” be there for me and he can’t handle the responsibilities of being in a relationship. he said he wants to just focus on uni. i was crying and basically hyperventilating to him, gave him all these solutions and kept emphasizing the email. he said nothing can change his mind and said “goodbye” and just left while i was crying. before he left i told him im gonna go to his house and talk it out (we literally live 7 mins away so idk why he did this over call) and he said i can’t. after he left, he sent me a text saying i can’t go to his house as im “crossing a boundary” and said there “shouldn’t be bad blood between us”. he then proceeded to block me on every single app. he even used ai to photoshop me out of his insta pfp before changing it to a photo i took of him. i was so confused, i was so hurt and so angry. despite everything i did, he ended it just like that. i reached out to his friends (who are also my friends) and asked if they knew anything, they tried communicating w him. i left most of the stuff he gave me in a bag in his garage (and made sure to include the photos we took 4 days prior as well as the love letter he wrote me on my birthday) and he found it shortly after. he then reached out to me a week later, said he heard “rumors”, i lashed out at him and he wrote paragraphs about how he’s sorry how things ended and i didn’t deserve it. he apologized for doing it on call, for not communicating w me earlier, for the reassurance i got 4 days prior, for the photoshop. he tried to give me “closure” over text but i demanded we meet irl so i can say my side too and he agreed. we met a couple weeks ago, i had a note on my phone w stuff i wanted to say to him. again, he kept emphasizing how his two main reasons were long distance (which i questioned bc he told me he’d never leave me over that, but he said his “doubts grew” and he didn’t want smth to happen to us when we were apart), and me putting in more effort, which made him feel “guilty” and that he didn’t deserve me. i told him i only wanted him and he took that in. he said he blocked me bc he’s “never been in a breakup and thought that’s what you do”. said he’s on some “religious journey” and said he doesn’t want to date at all. i kept calling him out on everything and he ended up apologizing profusely, he eventually got emotional and called himself a “horrible person” and said he “threw it all away”. he apologized for being a bad communicator. he genuinely seemed sincere. he had to leave before i could finish telling him what i wanted to say (i still have a lot left) bc his dad called him. he told me he’d unblock me everywhere and meet with me again to finish the conversation. he kept apologizing and said he’ll see me again. However, it’s been almost 2 weeks. i still haven’t been unblocked. he requested to follow me on insta 2 days after for a split second but then blocked me again. still heard nothing about meeting me again. he avoided discussing the topic w my friend and said he wants to “move on” but that’s unfair bc he lied to me. i heard he’s posting love songs and songs that i told him about in his insta notes. he’s still communicating w me on this gc that we have for a former school club bc we’re working on something, keeping it “professional” but it is driving me insane how he’s trying to act nice w me when im literally blocked on the app that gc is on. 

i’m sorry i wrote a lot. thank you to whoever made it to the end. i really want to finish the convo and get closure but i think he just doesn’t know what he wants rn and wants to avoid accountability. has anyone been in a similar situation? do u know the cause/what exactly is going on? i wake up everyday and feel so empty and i just want to stop feeling this way. i miss him, and i still love him. i showed him my love even while he was breaking up w me. he showed me so much affection until literally 4 days before he left me. only 2 weeks prior was his birthday party where we were so in love and i spent a lot of money on. i fucking hate what he did to me and i never ever expected it from him. now at the very least, i want what he promised me, to finish our conversation and to be unblocked. but it’s been two weeks. i’m still blocked. how can i go about this and does anyone have any idea about what he might be going through/what he’s feeling?

Do you ever truly move on after really long relationship?,"25M feeling like I would be really happy to die but not by my own hands (passive suicidal). I am the dumpee from the 7yrs of relationship and its been 7 months already since the breakup. I've been taking care of myself, have really good carreer, gym but life still feels empty without her. What am I supposed to do?

edit: its been NC ever since",13,5,2025-06-30 02:45:40,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnwo07/do_you_ever_truly_move_on_after_really_long/,,,"Glad to hear you are taking care of yourself. That is so crucial during the healing from heartbreak. It definitely takes time and intention to heal, learn about ourselves and then see a path into the future.  Are there things that you have been interested in but didn't do because she wasn't into them? This might be the time to do the things you've been curious about or thought would be fun or meaningful.  Also could be a good time to check in with what's important to you, what your values are, what is meaningful to you. When we're part of a couple, it can take some time for us to rediscover who we are as individuals.  Maybe try some novelty activities. Shake up your routine a bit. Go to new restaurants, grocery stores in the next town over, go on an adventure of some kind if you're into that.  I was married for 17 years and thought I would never, ever heal. I wanted to die and was very self-destructive. It took me a long time because my self-worth was too wrapped up in his opinion of me. But now, I absolutely love my life and wouldn't want to go back to him or the life we had. ||| It will get better i promise. 7 months sounds long for you, and we generally have high expectations of how fast we want to move on. It will take time and you will find light at the end of the tunnel.   A 6 year relationship ended for me in 2021. I was devastated and put myself into undue pressure to move on. I never thought I will. But in 2024 I was able to feel settled about the end. I was able to see why everything happened. I still love my ex and I'm so grateful for the relationship and his love. But I know in my whole being that the chapter is closed. I was in the city he lives in in Feb, and I did not meet him. 4 years later, I have grown way too much (assume he has too), that i didn't think he would even know me.  Please take it one day at a time. You will hurt and feel hopeless about life. Find grounding rituals. Therapy if you can afford it. And try to have friends you can have a life with.   I don't know how spiritual you are, but I believe that connections begin and end for a reason. Try to grow from it. Discover yourself and honor the relationship and the loss too.   I wish you the best and sending you a hug ! ||| You will go through a span of depression from the loss, and it does not feel like it at first, but you will pull through it. This takes time, and although 7 months seems like a long time, moving on is different for everyone. Get out and meet new people, do things that you enjoy.   I know as the dumpee, it is common to feel like you were not good enough, or it is your fault and over analyzing what you could have done differently, but this is not always the case at all. Some people are just not compatible, and that is okay because dating is essentially about trial and error. You will feel like there isnt anyone out there for you like them, and you will never be able to replace that; this is not reality. There are billions of people on this planet, and one is certainly more compatible to you than her.   It is especially important to eliminate everything that reminds you of the relationship. Although this can be hard because you feel like you are letting go of the memories and that part of your life, in reality it will help you more than anything. It gets rid of your access to those memories, which will hurt you more when you see them.   I hope this helps a little, please take care of yourself. It does get better."
Anyone here ever reconnected with their ex?,"I broke up with my Ex nearly 3 months ago, the relationship was on a decline and we were starting to treat each other awfully. There are other reason i decided to end it and it was the right decision for sure. 

Reason for this post is because i still love her ALOT, I don't know if she does but when I love someone I can't just get over it. We did a lot in the little over a year we were together and I've never connected so well with someone and someone who matched my views on things and overall chemistry. I want to work on myself now, get in shape and progress my career further, I know she will do the same. I was defiantly to blame for it ending as well though which is a fact, we both made mistakes and I can happily own up to it. We ended on good terms but I eventually had to block her as it would be harder for the both of us. 

I feel if I gave it another say 6 months I could try again, I need to sort myself out. Who knows, I may change my mind in that time but if I'm the same as now I'd want to try again and address the issue but I feel atm the wound is too fresh. 

To summarise has anyone ever got back with their Ex and it was a succes?",16,10,2025-06-30 01:55:02,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnvpfr/anyone_here_ever_reconnected_with_their_ex/,,,"honestly, reach out to her. i’m on the other side of your situation, he broke up with me, but the connection we shared was extremely similar. obviously start off small, just a chat or something to explain how you still feel and if there was a potential in rekindling. the worst thing that can happen is that she’s not interested anymore, but personally if my ex reached out and wanted to start fresh (even though it would take a lot of effort on both sides) i would definitely try it out. i wouldn’t wait longer since there is a chance that they could move on, so reach out as soon as you know that’s what you want. ||| I have but it wasn't done lightly and it was after a lot of time and healing on both our parts. I'm usually of the mindset that it's not the best idea, but sometimes there are exceptions.   I recently rekindled with my ex. We were only together for a very short time 7 years ago, she was struggling with alcohol and not healed from a prior 15 year relationship.   We stumbled across each other last year, started hanging out as friends first because we always got along well, that was never the problem. We didn't hang out with the aim of a relationship, it just naturally got to that point. We've now been together for 6 months. She's sober, has gone to therapy (as have I, I've been in therapy for years) and we're just not the same people we were.   All the things that drew us to each other years ago are still there, but now we're in healthier mindsets and there's so much more to ""us"" that just wouldn't have been possible back then.  This is all to say, it's possible, though unlikely. Unless major healing is done, time has passed and the work is put in. Otherwise you'll just repeat the same patterns. ||| Just did today. after going no contact for 3 months. We decided to do a check in progress report today FACETIME for 2 hours. We are healing apart but staying motivated to build a stronger relationship. * ||| All of my exes came back but the only one I reunited with was my ex hub . We were getting divorced but decided to try again and stayed married another 17 years.   I know loads of people who have reunited including 3 couples who married their ex spouses again some years later.   It can happen. Time will tell ||| i was the one breaking up at the beginning of this year after almost four years. We decided it doesn’t have to be forever. I was working on myself a lot and we started talking and meeting up again and I couldn’t believe how much he changed. The breakup really made him realise a lot of things and we decided to try again. If I realise over time that old habits are coming back or he stops making efforts again, I will not tolerate it anymore and may have wasted more time. But so far I can say that I would have regretted it a lot not giving us another chance. I don’t like the stereotype about coming back together with exes because people really can change and evolve. ||| “i love her a lot” every couple ever 😹😹 ||| Seriously move on It will not work and the problems will start to back .. neither she show actual reconnect with you like a message it could work but if she didn't don't do that ||| Yes and it was horrible. We happened to be in a seminar group together the semester after he dumped me. He approached me like nothing happened like “Oh Hey!” and small talk and he even started texting me. I thought he liked me and it was only 3 months after he dumped me so I still was in love. He was so kind, we talked more, hung out even. Then I admitted to him I still liked him then he completely cut me off and rushed to get away from me again saying he just cannot be in a relationship. Two months later, turns out he got a new girlfriend! So DO NOT reconnect at all costs. You will be humiliated again"
My ex left me 6 months after my brother died,We were in a relationship for two years. Honestly at the time i wanted to break up. So i just sgreed with her. Now i've been in therapy for the past 6 weeks twice a week and i have learned so much about myself. Digging myself out of this hole. I texted her 3 weeks after breakup seeing if she wanted to rebuild. She said no. Thst was out of desperation for me. I now know alot of my anger cane from ignoring my brothers death.

Putting people down after a break up?,"I was just wondering, I broke up and got back together with someone and they admitted they had to put me down after it ended. 

It was pretty recent after we got together and I ended it because I wasn’t sure I was in spot for a relationship or it was the right fit, I forgot how I said it but I thanked them for everything and that I was sorry but it was less of a conversation and more of I’ve made this descsion. I ended up going back after because I wasn’t sure if that was the right decision with how strong our connection was and explain I thought I made a mistake that I could see us working on our attachment together,
Anyway we ended up breaking up because my home life is chaotic and it left me needing a lot of alone time while they needed closeness. 
I was just wondering does anyone have to “put people down” after break ups 
Was it foolish to get back together with someone who said that? 
After leaving I only see the relationship as a learning lesson and that there was a lot of love there, I do think he could have handled things differently and I think I could have too. There were ways I showed up that make me feel sad but I know it’s just a part of unlearning behavior is to become aware of it. 
I just need to know is that’s healthy or not?

Feeling like “break up” even though it was never official.,"I’ve been close friends with this girl for years. We’ve both admitted to having deep feelings for each other in the past. We’ve hooked up throughout our friendship and gone back to being friends like nothing happened. 

Recently, some stuff happened that made it seem like we were finally going to do this and be in a real relationship. Then, out of nowhere she said she just wants to stay friends because she doesn’t want to ruin our friendship. I was shocked because honestly she’s always been the one chasing me. 

We’re in the same friend group and still talk occasionally, but I’m thinking about going no contact with her at least for a little bit to help myself get over her. I’ve tried cutting back our communication drastically, and that hasn’t helped at all. I feel stupid though for wanting to go no contact with someone I was never even dating. I’m ruining our friendship over an imaginary heartbreak. Meanwhile she doesn’t seem to think anything’s wrong. 

I just wanted to rant, thank you to anyone who read this. If you have anything to say that could help please let me know. ",1,0,2025-06-30 16:17:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lobrjy/feeling_like_break_up_even_though_it_was_never/,,,
why do they move on so quickly?,"it has been under 6 months since me and my ex broke up we were together for about 3 and a half years. 

his reason for breaking up with me was because he didn’t see a future with me anymore and thought he should be single.

Am I Really Moving On? Or Am I Just Coping With Uncertainty?…,"My partner broke up with me on the 5th of June. It was sudden for me.

We’d had a relationship going strong for 6 months after repairing a failed 3 month relationship mid way through last year. 

I’ve had my time to grieve, reconviene over text and talk with him, and he told me that he just didn’t have romantic feelings for me, but he does love me, it’s just platonic for him, which in itself I struggle to understand, especially after breaking up the first time because he had lost feelings, and then vowing to start a new relationship 3 months later where we’d share open honest communication throughout because he felt like even being friends still made him feel like something was missing between us. When me and him texted after we broke up this time around, I asked him if his platonic love meant he valued me as a friend, but he said he didn’t know what I meant when I asked that. Not once throughout our chats did he mention that he wanted to be friends with me, only that he wanted me in his life, he didn’t want to loose me, and that he was willing to recieve anything I was willing to offer him when it came to talking again in the future. 

We haven’t spoken at all in two weeks now. But we ended our conversation with me telling him I needed time, and maybe we’d be able to talk at some point when uni starts, since unfortunately we are going to the same uni. He told me that he’d be happy to give me the time, and “maybe when uni starts we can start to try out a new relationship between the two of us”. Given the context of what’s happened between us, “relationship” is a very confusing word, and when I’ve spoken to friends about it, I’ve had mixed responses saying “he could just mean a friendship” while others assume he plans to jump into another relationship with me in the future.

I reside with both arguments to what he means by that, but given the fact that we’ve stepped away before and reconviened to start a new relationship it makes me wonder if that’s what he expects to happen again. If he meant a friendship, then why wouldn’t he just say “start to try a friendship between the two of us”? 

Nonetheless, I’ve been trying to not let that get to me, I’ve started trying to move on, deleting our chats, removing photos of us from my phone. I’ve stopped venting so much to friends about him because I know that it gets to a point where they don’t want to hear about it anymore because it’s not like they can fix anything permenantly with a few words of comfort. I’d say overall I’m progressing quite nicely, but every now and then when I’m alone, or after I’ve had a long day, I miss him that little bit more, and that empty feeling comes flooding back in.

I miss when missing him wasn’t a bad thing, and he was just a message away. I miss hearing his name and thinking “oh my gosh someone’s just mentioned my person”. I miss how much i loved learning to understand him and his quirks, I miss the feeling that no matter how much changes in my life, I sat comfortably with the idea that there was someone who would always be there for me. I miss looking forward to seeing him, I miss the way he treated me, sent me posts out of no-where expressing his love for me, his little random texts telling me he loved me. I miss the first time he said I love you, I miss all the times I felt safe with him. I just miss someone who i thought was my person. My partner. It makes me cringe to even consider him an “Ex”.

I know if we do start talking again when uni starts in a few months time, there’s potential that we could end up going through the same cycle again. I am cautious of that which is why I’m trying to move on and remove the hope that comes with talking again in September. But god I just miss him. I’ve seen videos telling me that “I don’t miss him, I miss the feeling of being with him” but it’s all crap. I’m trying to move on but I can’t help but miss everything about him, and us, and the way he treated me. I genuinely think about him every day, wether that thought be big or small, he’s still there. Am I really trying to move on? Because some days it just feels like I’m coping with the uncertainty that could become of us talking again in the future.",1,0,2025-06-30 16:10:32,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lobkx6/am_i_really_moving_on_or_am_i_just_coping_with/,,6 month(s),
Should I break up with him after 4 years?,"God, it feels so alien to type this out. 
I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years, he’s been by best friend and confidante. I love him unconditionally, but the issue between us has always been how avoidant he is with hard emotional topics. 
He has childhood trauma, and maybe this is why I still have so much empathy towards him and excuse his actions towards me. He was never taught how to love someone, or trust someone with his emotions or fears.

In no means is he a bad person, but a deeply flawed man. I’ve begged multiple times to just walk by his side, to let me in not to give him solutions but a shoulder to lean on. 

We’ve had a lot of issues with this, also with how cold he comes off over text or putting effort to be interested in my passions, hobbies, studies like I’ve always tried to with him.

All arguments we’ve had, I’ve begged him to just listen to me, but he always avoids accountability and deflects or switches the topic completely. He’s knowingly left me spiraling and crying the whole night while he slept.

Tonight he actually did tell me what’s been going on in his mind, after I had to force him to be honest with me. Because usually he says he’s okay but I know he’s not so I try to comfort him or investigate.
He told me he regrets making promises he couldn’t keep, when he had talked about marriage. He told me a lot of things are stressing him out, and I cause him the most stress with expectations. And it all just hit hard to the point I couldn’t reply, his last words were calling himself a coward. 


I don’t want to blame him… but I mourn the girl I was just before I met him. I isolated myself from friendships, and neglected my studies during these past 4 years. I truly feel like my entire world is falling apart. And what sucks the most… is I want him to fight for me. I’ve begged him to. And he never has, even until now. I feel like irreparable damage has been made… because I don’t know if I overreacted or demanded too much, even when standing up for myself on the bare minimum of love.


Maybe I already know the answer to my own question, but there are moments of hope. And the Pandora’s box of all our memories from the past four years that force me to keep fighting… I just wish he’d do the same for me. I feel worthless, and that maybe the kind of love I wish I could feel reciprocated doesn’t exist…",1,1,2025-06-30 16:09:44,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lobk5o/should_i_break_up_with_him_after_4_years/,,4 year(s),"literally had the same thing happen to me--about 2 months post-breakup and i'm much happier unfortunately   i was pouring everything into someone who couldn't/wouldn't let his walls down, who either couldn't/wouldn't see me, who couldn't/wouldn't engage on things at the same level as me. and it sucked because it wasn't like that all of the time...but it got to where it was Most of the time.   don't make anybody make you feel worthless. it's ridiculously hard & it'll hurt pretty bad on the other side of things for a while but i feel for you & encourage you to examine if this is how you really want to spend the rest of your life, knowing that things might not ever improve no matter how much effort you throw at it  it feels so untrue when you're in the relationship but there are literally billions of people on the planet and just because you have spent a lot of time with one person that makes you feel less than doesn't mean there aren't many more who wouldn't make you feel that way"
The Hope That Drowned Me,"I’ve started taking my meds again. Not with anger, not with shame— just with a quiet heaviness in my chest.

I really thought I had moved past this phase of my life. I convinced myself I was healed, that I was stronger. But now I see… I wasn’t healing— I was just hiding. I buried my feelings, ignored the weight of my own pain, hoping that if I didn’t look at it, it would disappear on its own.

But the truth always finds a way to surface. And this truth— the one I didn’t want to face, the one I prayed wasn’t real— stared me right in the face.

I was holding onto a dream. A dream of a happy ending, of us, of something beautiful. But sometimes… hope can become a burden when it’s tied to the wrong person. And believing in someone who was never truly yours— it’s a quiet kind of heartbreak, the kind that steals your peace piece by piece.

So I’m choosing to start again. Not because I’ve given up— but because I deserve better. Because my mind deserves peace, and my heart deserves truth.

I’m taking my meds again not out of weakness, but out of strength— because I want to heal for real this time. I want to show up for myself. And I want to place my hope in something —and someone— that’s truly worth believing in: me",1,0,2025-06-30 16:09:24,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lobjv1/the_hope_that_drowned_me/,,,
life without you. 2 months.,"realizing life is better without the person you’d thought you’d share it with forever

what an eerie feeling

better in the sense that it is my life again now.

less tears. more smiles. no more constant questioning of my place in someone’s life.

but i won’t forget the good times either. the laughs, the tender moments, the gentleness we both carried for one another. 

do i miss them? of course. do i wish things had gone differently? of course. to some degree.

i guess now i’m just being shown a new path as the other one has closed and the gates have been locked. 

and im not mad at this new path. 

i wish you luck on your new path, too,

He came back and my progress is gone.," After a month and a half after he broke up with me he came back texting me about how he regrets breaking up and misses me. I listened to him, but it was clear that he hadn’t changed, he was telling me what I wanted to hear. Hes done it before, telling me one thing and then changing his mind later. I can’t help but not believe his words. I even saw him in person again, and it still felt cold. 
 That month a half I started to rebuild. I was starting to get stronger, and regain some sort of normalcy again..for it to be gone in an instant. 
I’m left feeling depressed and weak. The things I was doing before he reached out were starting to feel easy, but now they’re hard. I feel more tired, and want to sleep all the time.

What's up with some men being insensitive in delicate health situations,"Hi, just got diagnosed with lung fibrosis, life expectancy abt 3 - 5 years, looks like I already had it for about 2.

Cannot hv support, so I'll protect my peace kind of thing. My female friends on the other hand were wonderful 2me  theese past weeks. 
Wtf is up with some men being plain insensitive when it comes to a serious health problem one will not heal from. Both acted like I'd be back 2normal in no time, one wanting his girlfriend package with regular sex just like we used to and the other who apparently sufferes from verbal diarrhoea of some sort, expected I'd listen fr hours to his pseudo science opinions.

How to deal with breakup and emotions after?,"How do I stop thinking about my ex-partner? I'm aware that I'm not perfect either, that I became toxic toward the end, but what he did to me really hurt. And I feel like even three weeks after the breakup, I still can't handle these emotions. I feel both relief and pressure because of everything that happened. But on the other hand, I catch myself thinking that he doesn't even feel bad about the breakup, that he's enjoying himself now and allowing people to do things he never allowed me to do. For example, he asked me if I can stop sending pictures of his dog to my friends, because he doesn't want for everyone to know that he has a dog, and now I can see his friends posting dog on instagram stories, but for me it was ""forbidden"".I don’t know how to stop these thoughts.",2,3,2025-06-30 12:13:25,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo5xrg/how_to_deal_with_breakup_and_emotions_after/,,,"I used to be at a similar spot, really obsessing over the girls I dated. What I realized was that it was all because of subconscious patterns that I wasn’t willing to face. Once I became aware of them and processed them, it completely changed my attachment type, how I felt for my ex, and the type of women I was attracted towards."
Dealing with regret,"A few months ago, I made a decision that I still wrestle with: I ended a relationship with someone I truly loved. At the time, I was overwhelmed by internal conflict I was trying to be present for my child and the mother of my child, while still carrying emotional ties to the woman I’d fallen in love with.

I chose what felt like stability over what felt like emotional alignment. And when I tried to go back to rebuild the relationship I left, it was too late she’d been hurt and had begun to move on. I respected her boundaries and didn’t try to manipulate the situation. I’ve taken full responsibility for the pain my indecision caused her, and I’ve tried to grow from it.

We reconnected recently before she left for another country, and there were kind words, shared laughter, even soft moments. She said she misses me. She also reminded me that we’re over.

I’ve been stuck between acceptance and hope. I’ve done everything I can to heal therapy, journaling, applying for work, staying grounded. I’m proud of how I’ve shown up lately, but the truth is… I still miss her. I still love her. I still wonder if the door will open again. But I also know I need to keep walking, even if it doesn’t.

Would love to hear how others have dealt with the weight of regret, the hope for reconnection, and the process of becoming whole again even when the ending wasn’t what you wanted.

For example, there is a new movie coming out that he would’ve loved to see and I can’t tell if I want to go watch it for me or because it’ll make me feel connected to him you know? I don’t want him back so I’m just confused.

"He’s leaving for a mission, and I’m left picking up the pieces","Hey Reddit,  
A month ago, I went through my first real breakup. He's not dating anyone else—he said we were breaking up because he's going on an LDS mission. But the stupid thing is… he hasn't even left. He hasn't even put in his papers. He doesn't know when he's leaving, or where he's going. It felt like the idea of a mission was more real to him than our relationship ever was.

Looking back, I think the *real* reason we broke up is that I told him I wouldn't wait for him while he was away. I'm 16. Two years is a long time, and I told him honestly that I wouldn't be putting my life on hold. I think that's what triggered the breakup more than anything. He needed someone who'd pause their entire world for him, and I wasn't going to do that.

But we still snapped after. He kept sending heart emojis and compliments, and I let myself hope. I thought maybe he still cared—perhaps we weren't over. So I told him I still loved him. And I asked if he wanted to try again.

He said I was a distraction. And that I should use this breakup to become a better person.

That shattered me. He was the one sending mixed signals. He was the one who wouldn't give me what I needed emotionally *while we were together.* And now I was the ""distraction""? It hurt. It made me feel like I was crazy for caring, for hoping, for being honest.

I have anxious attachment, and I told him that early on. I told him what helped, what I needed, and he said he'd try—but nothing changed. I asked for simple things, like flowers, and consistent texts, and he never followed through. I think I held onto a fantasy more than the reality. That's on me, but it still hurts.

Our relationship was only two months, but I still can't move on, and it's been a month. I still see him all the time because we share things with each other's family, and it's become hard. 

Since then, I've tried to move on. I've done silly pick-up lines and tried being bold. Pretended I was fine. But a lot of that was just me trying to rebuild the self-worth I lost. Sometimes I still miss him. Sometimes I feel phantom kisses. But I'm starting to realize I'm not broken—I'm just healing. It's stupid, but I still keep thinking maybe if I had done something different, we would still be together. 

I've been doing a lot of thinking. About why I cared so much. About what kind of love I really want. About how even now, I still catch myself comparing new people to him, even though I know I shouldn't. Your first relationship really does leave a lasting impression on you.

And here's the thing—I don't even know how to start dating again. How to flirt without faking confidence. How to Stop Feeling Like I'm Too Much or Not Enough. I want someone new, but I don't want to lose myself in the process of finding it.

So if you've been through something like this—especially your first love falling apart—please tell me I'm not insane. Or just let me know I'm not alone in this mess.

Thanks for reading.

How to end long distance relationship?,"I'm in a long-distance relationship with a woman I met online earlier this year, and we met in person in her country back in March. The more I’ve gotten to know her, the more I’ve realised I don’t feel the spark I hoped for. I’m at a point now where I just don’t know how to end things especially because it would come as a complete shock to her and impact her mental health. She’ll ask why, and I don’t have a dramatic reason, or any reason except that I don't feel that spark. She hasn’t done anything wrong. I just don’t feel that connection, and I know there’s **nothing** she could change about herself nor would I want her to.

Brief background about her: I’m her first **serious** boyfriend (she is 29), and she’s told me many times how much she loves me and how she can’t imagine life without me. She says she can't live without me.  Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if she said she’d take a bullet for me.  She is living with some of her sisters in a studio apartment in an expensive city, while she finishes her studies in about a year. Her sisters can be controlling or/and insensitive.  She is conscious about being nearly 30, understandably.  Before we met, she struggled badly with her mental health because of her living situation with her sisters and being physically and mentally abused (nothing sexually) by her family. Since we started talking, and with the support and love I have given her, she’s said her mental health has improved a lot and I can actually see the improvement.  However, she has said that she would rather die than live in her country permanently.  She has repeated that several times on several different occasions. 

When I met her in her country, I promised her a trip to visit me as a tourist in my country and to introduce her to my family within a couple of months. But because of a major staffing shake up at work (beyond my control) *during* my holiday, I wasn’t able to bring her when I said I would. She was devastated and doubted my intentions, but after I explained that there was no point in her visiting while I was stuck at work—and her family backed that up and she finally understood. Still, the doubt lingered in her head, understandably. Since then, she’s been **begging** me to get her out of her country **ASAP**. I told her early on in the relationship that **if** we were still together after two years, I’d apply for a partner visa so she could come live with me permanently - and that's **absolutely** true. It's 2 years minimum for a partner visa in my country.  From day one, she’s been planning her whole life around that with me - talking about kids, homes, career, and building a future together in my country as she is approaching her 30s.

I’ve helped her financially by helping her with her tuition fees, living expenses, and small inexpensive gifts. No one has ever been that kind to her and not asked for anything in return. She always posts about them on Facebook and tells her family about these things. I’ve met some of her family (they even gave me some souvenirs when I met them), and she constantly talks about me to them, saying how well I treat her.

Yesterday, I brought up a potential source of passive income she hadn’t properly pursued yet (nothing megabucks). But the conversation took a difficult turn. She reacted emotionally, sharing how overwhelmed she felt by the constant pressure from her family and now from me as well. The weight of her situation in her home country is not just finances; she is grappling with deeper emotional strains and a sense of entrapment. Her hope, as she had shared with me before, is to find a man that is emotionally and financially stable and kind who could help her build a better life elsewhere. Although **I do absolutely care** for her and have the means to support such a transition, I have found myself confronting an uncomfortable truth: the depth of emotional love needed to make that kind of sacrifice was no longer there. Had I still been in love, I would still continue supporting her.

Rather than just breaking up with her ""out of the blue"" for a ""random reason"", would it be fairer to just say I’m not in a position to support her financially the way she wants and deserves?  This avoids going into the ""whys"" of not loving her?

Her birthday is coming up in a month and I feel shit for doing it so soon before that.  Then she has a new dream job starting around the same time, and I don't want her to mess that up because of me. A week or two for her to get over the initial shock is better than doing it when she starts her new job.

I know there’s no perfect way to break this off and whatever I say, it’s going to shatter her dreams. She’ll be embarrassed in front of her friends and family. She will say I wasted her time, I was never serious (**not** true). And most of all, I’m worried about how it will impact her mental health.

If anyone has suggestions on how to end this with care, I would really appreciate it.  I know not to argue with her and play the blame game.  She can accuse me of anything (even if not true), and I won't be upset.   Thank you. ",1,0,2025-06-30 15:41:14,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1loataw/how_to_end_long_distance_relationship/,,,
Ex wants me back after dumping me and 2 weeks of NC,"Me (34F) and my ex (35M) were together for almost 5 years, living together for 3.5 years. Our relationship was wonderful for the most part, we were best friends, lovers, partners in crime, he was there for me during grad school, really difficult days, mental and emotional breakdowns, when I was scammed, we moved to a different state together, we shared finances and house chores, we took care of each other, that’s why I brought up marriage and future around 2 years ago which he was surprised by because he said he never thought about it! During the past 2 years we had many many conversations about this and he just sounded doubtful and fearful, saying he never wants to have kids due to economy, education system being bad, gun violence, having no family system, and his own childhood. Which fair, but also I just wanted to see his openness and support and him fully being a partner in life with me. He also said if there’s no kids, there’s no point in marriage either. That most marriage fail. I come from a broken home with parents wanting to kill each other but I still wanted to marry him because of us and knowing how solid we’ve been. Eventually we had so many talks and sometimes fights that we were realizing more and more that we just can’t cover the gap. He was getting more avoidant and cold and He dumped me on my birthday but I was so dependent that I begged him to give us a chance, so he dumped me again 1 month after my birthday lol. 
This time I finally understood that me loving someone harder won’t make them want me or want same things as me. It was a brutal 2 weeks but I actually completely got over my addiction to him, I started to sleep all night and I was able to eat and go out with friends and have fun and I got a car, and was starting to feel excited to be me again and plan for my future, in the meanwhile we still live together because our lease ends in 2 months, however we barely saw each other and that helped. I just felt like I didn’t even know him anymore and was starting to read and learn about our attachment styles, seeing the issues and so on. That I need to figure out what I want and what type of person I want to be with, basically work on myself. 2 weeks in he said he wants to talk to me. That he wants me back, that he said those things out of fear but he wants to face them and needs my help and support and that he’s still fluctuating but doesn’t want to lose us. And now I’m back to palpitations and not being able to sleep. I seriously don’t know what to say or do. I wrote a letter asking questions like what changed and why now. Up till yesterday I thought I love him and now I feel like I’m being played like a toy. I feel bad for myself for going through so much in 2 weeks. What would be the healthy and right step now?

I still look at his new girlfriends social media and they just celebrated a year (meaning we had a gray area overlap which killed me when I learned that)

Even when I do avoid social media, it feels like my own brain TORTURES me with memories and what ifs. I think about him every day, multiple times a day. I feel hopeless in ever being able to fully move on and realize I will find someone else. It feels like I lost the best thing I could have. 

Open to harsh advice lol ",1,2,2025-06-30 15:35:08,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1loanii/i_need_advice_going_about_this_break_up_all_wrong/,,,"I understand your pain, but if it makes you feel any better, the fact that he overlapped two relationships probably shows why you shouldn't feel so sad about having lost him. Sure, you made mistakes like all of us, like he did too.  Relationships aren't black and white, it's rarely only one person's fault. Which is also why people who truly love and care for each other find a way to make it work instead of just giving up and running to someone else without real closure or without a real attempt to fix their relationship first."
Will she ever regret it? Or was I just a placeholder?,"I (19M) was her first real emotional home. She (19F) was mine too — though I was her 4th guy, I treated her like my only one.
We were university classmates. It started from class notes, turned into long convos, love confessions, promises, and eventually, deep emotional and physical intimacy. I tied her shoelaces, brought her food, stayed up helping her with studies, and carried her emotional burdens like they were my own.
She had no father — her uncles controlled her life. One day, they brought a rishta: a bald, 3
27-something engineer in Germany. Rich, stable, and exactly what society calls ""ideal."" She cried. She said she loved me. She told her mother about me. Said she couldn’t imagine being with anyone else.
But when the time came to take a stand, she folded. No fight. No explanation. Just silence and distance.
I was begging. I was crying. I humiliated myself over and over — and she let me.
For 38 days, I was treated like trash. Blocked, ignored, insulted, used. She even had the audacity to say “You don’t have the right to give me bad duas, I already have enough of them.” Like I was just a burden now.
And here’s the kicker: her new husband’s name is also Abdullah.
Imagine the slap.
I’ve tried to move on. I’ve gone silent. I’m focusing on fitness, looksmaxing, business, skin care, peace. But sometimes I wonder...
Will she ever regret it?
Or did she just use me to pass time until someone “better” showed up?
Her best friend recently reacted to my Instagram reel and said she told her “not bad” and “good” — like I’m just an update in a forgotten story. Not a heartbreak. Not a human. Just a reel.
I still helped her with studies even after the disrespect. But she couldn’t even stand seeing my tears. She had the audacity to say “I can’t console you” like I was disgusting for having emotions.
Be real with me Reddit —
Will she ever feel it?
Or was I just some naive boy who thought love could win against culture, money, and cowardice?
And yeah, I’m not denying it anymore:
She didn’t choose me. She didn’t even fight for me.
She gave up like it was nothing.
So tell me…
Does that haunt people later? Or do they just move on like we never mattered at all?",1,0,2025-06-30 15:32:46,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1loalcd/will_she_ever_regret_it_or_was_i_just_a/,,38 day(s),

6 month update,"I don't really know what to put in this, so it'll be more like bulleted?

But It's been 6 days past 6 months of me getting cheated on and broken up with. I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have feelings for this person. But I'm also at the point where I view them as a different person because of their actions and their inaction to work on things, for those going through a breakup, just be the best you that you can be. 

Don't sleep around, hit the gym, focus on yourself and your well-being, force yourself out of the house, feel your feelings when they come, focus on hobbies, listen to music and find lyrics or riffs or melodies you can relate to. These are things that I've done and that've helped me.

I'm still in the process of dealing with everything, this is a person I've spent years with and have sacrificed much for, so obviously it's gonna take a bit. And know that if your friends are trying to get you to move on faster, know that they don't want to hurt you, they just miss your smile :). 

There's still some bad behaviors I need to work on, I look at the music she listens to, I still have hope she'll call me and want to work on things, that she'll show up at places only we know about, and It's okay that I have these feelings, I need to feel them to grow from them.

I ran into her a few days ago, saw her when exiting the store, that was the first time I'd seen her in 6 months. She lives less than 10 minutes away, yet she is still so far.

For those going through something similar, know that you are deserving of everything you put out. Half the reason I restrain myself from reaching out and begging to work on things is that I got cheated on, okay? I worry that even if she showed up, put in all the effort, time, and money into me that I have for her, I would never feel like the only boy again. 

Thanks for reading this - I know it's not put together the best.



Some music that's helped me out:

Poison the Well - Tear From The Red 

Type O Negative - Bloody Kisses 

Kublai Khan - A Brotherhood Of Man & The Hammer

Aphex Twin - Xtal & #19 (stone in focus)

Buckethead - Electric Tears

  
Be your own guardian angel.

So basically me & my ex broke up 2 months ago. Won’t get into the breakup much cuz it was a very random breakup & i didn’t see it coming he broke up w me saying i was v toxic. 2 days after the breakup he started texting other girls didn’t surprise me cuz he was always a fuckboy & put on a show that i changed for you bs. 14 days after the breakup he started texting the girl he once kissed while we were together it was just a 7 month relationship he cheated & yes i forgave i was too blind i still am to some extent.I texted his friends & sneaked w his childhood friend cuz i wasn’t in my senses & did stuff to get his attention. So basically i got to know that he met this girl literally at a cafe behind my home & i crashed out i told the girl some stuff about him for the 2nd time & she cut him off. Literally the day i told her a lot of drama happened & somehow i bumped into him at a cafe we met & we kissed so fucking weird right i know but it’s us idk. Then we have been in touch since then met a few times talked on calls he told me about his chicks i told him about guy my talking stage basically. Sometimes he talked really nicely & sometimes he wanted to stop being in touch. We had sex twice. He told me about this girl that told him i like you but i also like someone else i like 2 people at the same time. & idk somehow we talked less after the sex i confronted this to him that 3 days we didn’t talk much you just use me for sex he literally went crazy & said some mean stuff to me a lot of mean stuff. yeah i actually met my talking stage 10 mins after we had sex he said he didn’t like it but whatever. so the same night we went to this party & i saw him holding hands w a girl she’s the same girl i guess. & i crashed out the girl was pretty ugly so didn’t mind but i texted him that i expected the girl to be pretty atleast. He said she’s pretty & again that let’s not be in contact. So the v next day i was w my sister & her cat he bumped into us & called me that i want to meet your sisters cat so he met the cat & went i was beside him so he started saying stuff like now i will go home & watch reels & then i will talk to girls.

It’s been a year since break up.,"40F can’t stop thinking about my 39M ex. I’ve never in my life experienced this with a break up.
We were together for about 7 months in totally.
And this was one of my shortest relationships- I was married for 8 yrs.
Please tell me there is someone out there that is experiencing this.. My ex is an avoidant and broke up with me almost a year ago. We didn’t have a bad break up just his insecurities. The first few months were hard, I couldn’t stop crying. I also think he has a little bit narcissistic personality disorder- but I don’t know if it’s from his “ex cheating or his childhood trauma. Either way, I totally miss him. And I’m afraid that we were soulmates.. I’ve tried dating and met a few wonderful guys but for some reason I just can’t stop thinking about him.

I reached out a few months ago and he was so confusing, he said he missed me and wanted to talk then he freaked out and said we couldn’t talk anymore.

I don’t want to be in a relationship with him, I just can’t explain why he is constantly on my mind. I still think about him sexually as well.

What is this!???

",1,4,2025-06-30 15:21:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1loaaum/its_been_a_year_since_break_up/,,,I’m just here to say that I’m experiencing the same thing. Both of us are fearful avoidant and dated 6 months and kept in touch for 10 months post break up. Currently 7 months of no contact and it’s gotten better. I have the same issue ruminating about the relationship and thinking about the sex. All I can say it’s rough. Therapy has helped though. ||| Just let it go it’s not worth it seriously
he’s moving on. please help me.,"I was with my high school sweetheart for 10 years when we finally broke up, including a failed engagement. 

The relationship was toxic, abusive. He was an alcoholic and I ended up cheating. It is far more nuanced than that summary can ever convey but please believe me when I say that we both are very different people now. 

We are now just two months shy of two years broken up. Neither of us have dated. I’ve been on dating apps since the breakup, he joined dating apps in April. He remained in the town we lived and kept our friends, I moved home and lost everything. I know I seem like the bad guy and though I wasn’t innocent, there was equal blame to be shared. 

I begged for him back for the first year of our breakup. He was not having it- often berating me and requesting no contact. Then, in the summer, he wanted to get back together right when I started feeling okay finally. We saw each other a few times but nothing ever happened. 

Over the past year, we’ve been toying with the idea of getting back together but I’ve said I need more time. He is a different person than he was when we dated but by the end, I was scared of him and didn’t know if I could jump back in. 

Fast forward to him being the best version of himself he’s ever been - a version I BEGGED for at least 6 years - and he’s seeing someone new. After just two months on the apps. He’s “taking it serious”. I am wrecked. I am so angry and upset that a new girl gets the best version of him and I wasted ten years of my life with someone who ended up resenting me. She’s 24, the age that I was when we broke up, and I’m just so mad that she gets a clean slate with this version of him. 

 “I’m a wreck” is an understatement. I knew that I had feelings still but I am out of my mind. I want to jump out of my skin. I can’t do this. I don’t want him to be dating someone new.

There’s so much more but I just am so frazzled. I am so broken. This is literal hell on earth.

I don’t know if I’m really understanding the breakup,So my girlfriend and I recently (within the week) just broke up she broke up with me and I didn’t want to cause I felt like that we probably could be fixed it but she disagreed so now I’ve found myself sad but like it doesn’t feel like we have even broken up like I know we have and I still get that heavy feeling in my chest it hurts to fall asleep and sucks to wake up. But I feel like I haven’t let myself truly feel the breakup. I think I’m comparing this to my breakups before this when I was completely torn apart and like not functioning. So maybe I’m just handling this one much better. Because I know how to not handle it like Before I would go days without sleeping or eating and all I could do was pretty much lay in bed and cry. This time around Ive been going to the gym everyday hanging out with my friends and playing video games. And even when I am alone I have my moments where I’m upset but I just don’t feel destroyed all the time like beforeI still think about her and all of that but it just almost literally doesn’t feel real even though it’s very real I honestly don’t know I know we are broken up and I am sad about this but I just feel like i haven’t fully registered like I probably will never see her again and that it’s over and I need to move on. So my question is am I letting myself feel the breakup or am I just pushing my feelings back and I will feel it later which I don’t want id rather deal with it right now.

I don’t know how to fully let go,"I (F, early 20s) recently cut things off with someone I loved deeply, my best friend (M, same age). We were incredibly close. I was his safe space, and he was mine. We shared everything. He used to say, “You’re the only person I’ve ever been this real with.” We were on the phone every night. He’d get vulnerable when tired, flirt with me like it meant something, talk about the future sometimes… It felt like we were already something, just unnamed.

But it was always murky. There were days he’d open up completely, and days he’d pull away like he was afraid of being seen. I now realize, he’s likely avoidant. Deeply avoidant. He grew up with his own emotional baggage, and while he cared, he was terrified of intimacy. He’d make me feel wanted one second, then disappear emotionally the next. It was a constant loop of closeness and distance. I never knew where I stood.

After months of this, I finally confessed. I told him how I felt.

He didn’t say no. In fact, he said he’d felt the same for a long time, but didn’t want to confess cause he knew it would never work out. In fact, I noticed him withdrawing at times and would spiral thinking it’s my fault but he later admitted to pulling away so he wouldn’t get too attached and when I asked him why he didn’t completely he said it’s cause he wanted me too and missed me too much. He then asked for time, came back we spent three days where he told me we should try but then would change his mind but wasn’t fully ready to let me go and block him either. He even told me he couldn’t stop thinking about this, couldn’t work, couldn’t gym, his heart rate was high ever since I told him and I could hear how shocked and shaken he was in his voice. I gave him a day to fully decide and he came back and said he was conflicted maybe not ready. But then he even told me it would be the same as what we were already doing for the past two months(in a relationship but just without the label) and said we should try and then dropped a bomb: he’d just filed for his green card, and legally couldn’t leave the U.S. for the next five years. He asked, “Can we survive long-distance for that long, without even seeing each other?” And when I hesitated, when I panicked, he said, “Then maybe we shouldn’t try.” As if that was it.

So I told him I needed to block him to move on, we both cried but he didn’t stop me this time and I did block him, for two hours during which I practically bawled my eyes out. I broke down, unblocked him. I begged him to stay, told him I couldn’t handle this ending without trying. He agreed, saying 5 years is maybe too far and we’re overthinking “Okay, let’s try long-distance.” I told him and asked him multiple times that let’s no because he isn’t ready and what if he was just saying yes because w I was crying. He reassured me, told me he wanted it, told me he was dating to marry me. I also voiced my concerns about him pulling back and distancing randomly and he told me he’s not leaving, he’s right here and got me through my whole panic attack and told me to go rest after that. 

But after the moment he agreed… he emotionally disappeared. He didn’t text to check on me. He didn’t act like someone who had just entered a relationship. He just… vanished emotionally. Again. And I had kind of expected this because even when he agreed I didn’t feel happy or relief only dread, waiting for the other shoe to drop and was left doubting everything. Did he say yes because I was crying? Was he guilted into it? Was I forcing him to stay?

He was breadcrumbing me. Watching my stories. Messaging my best friend to ask if I’m okay. But not talking to me. Not showing up for me. Not choosing me.

He even told my best friend he’s worried I’m just a rebound for him, even though he’s the one who kept initiating intimacy for months. He flirted, confided, teased, and relied on me emotionally, but when it came time to step up, he just didn’t. I feel used, confused, and discarded.

And still, I miss him. I miss my best friend. I miss the person I thought he was, or maybe just the person I was with him.

I’ve always struggled with anxious attachment, and this entire situation has triggered my worst fears: of not being enough, of being too much, of being abandoned. I’ve had panic attacks. I’ve cried until I couldn’t breathe. I wake up in the middle of the night with a pit in my stomach and dreams where he’s choosing not to be with me all over again. I’ve had to try meds but they don’t work but I think I’m getting better on my own, crying and letting it all out. 

Everyone tells me: “You didn’t lose someone who loved you. You lost someone who couldn’t love you the way you deserve.” But it doesn’t make it hurt less.

I want to move on. I want to forget him. But I feel like my body is still waiting. Still hoping he’ll say: “I messed up. I want you.” Even though I know that’s not fair to either of us.

If you’ve ever loved someone who never fully chose you, who kept you close but never close enough, how did you let go?",1,2,2025-06-30 15:04:20,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo9uvg/i_dont_know_how_to_fully_let_go/,,,I'm really sorry to hear that.

It’s hard, but it’s the only way out. ||| If you regret it so much and know that there's somewhere you fucked up why not reach out? 😞 Moving on doesn't happen overnight it's a rollercoaster and forgiving yourself will help you ||| [ Removed by Reddit ] ||| I always prefer the phrase ""move forward"" instead of ""move on"". I guess it's the connotations of the phrases, moving on sounds like you're leaving everything behind and ""forgetting"" whatever happened.

So I guess just tell yourself, you don't have to just move on, rather work towards continuing on with your life with everything that already happened. ||| I can add you into a support group chat if you’d like. ||| You will find out in the end after all is said and done that moving on is the only thing you can do.

He’s literally stalking me,This guy left me (ghosted and discarded) for his ex and got her pregnant about four months after me. I can understand why he went back to her because she’s a bum like him and he’s not on my level. The entire time for over 6 months while his girl is pregnant he’s been watching me till this day daily on my Instagram stories and I do take breaks from posting but as soon as I post he’s there. Mind you I’ve never followed him on Instagram and he doesn’t follow me. He also doesn’t use his actual Instagram account. He uses burner accounts which I blocked and those anonymous story viewer websites. He doesn’t miss a day and sometimes it’s multiple times a day. Around my birthday and on my vacation it was obsessive. I already called him out about it but he doesn’t care. I recently found out about the baby and that it’s due in September. So I called him last Sunday when I was drunk multiple times screaming at him and he answered every single time. Where was his girl? Idk but I also texted her letting her know about him and she seemed nonchalant about it,1,0,2025-06-30 14:59:07,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo9ppt/hes_literally_stalking_me/,,,
My ex girlfriend of 8 years is pregnant (not mine),"My ex-girlfriend (same age, 35) and I were together for 8 years. We officially broke up at the end of September. We’ve only spoken once since then, and that was in December—just to clear the air and make sure there was no hate between us. She didn’t say much; I did most of the talking. Since then, it’s been no contact.
Fast forward to yesterday—she announced on Instagram that she’s 3 months pregnant. I don’t have social media, but I had to go look after people asked me about it.  She didn’t post who the father is, so a couple of people reached out to ask if I was the dad.. So people asking That stung a little. I’ve been feeling a bunch of emotions because we always talked about having a family someday, and now, not even a year after our breakup, she’s starting one with someone else.
This whole thing is odd because this time last year we were in Puerto Rico. Heck she even posted a picture I took of her there 3 days prior to her announcement. 
I did call her and sent a congratulations text, but she didn’t respond—and I get why. Still, I’m feeling jealous that she was able to move on so fast, while I’m still stuck in this limbo. In a way, it’s a good thing—it gives me closure. I can finally close the door on the idea of us getting back together.
But I’m also a little angry that I got wrapped up in this drama. People are contacting me, and it all could’ve been avoided if she had just posted the father. I’m currently in therapy.
It’s been weird lately. I’m not depressed anymore, but I’m not really happy either. I’m in this middle ground. It’s nice, but odd. I feel like I should be happy, but I’m just kind of numb—just existing. I’m just glad I’m not as sad anymore.
Sorry—I know I’m just rambling and ranting at this point. I figured I’d scream this into the void and get it off my chest

She fucked up and i fucked up harder. She then deaomonsied me and then dumped me. Listened to her fake friends and left.

It’s way better to let things flow naturally. If you keep texting her all the time, you’ll just push her away. Women often get attracted to what feels out of reach, so ghost mode is key.

That way, you’ll be in a much stronger position when she shows interest or gives some kind of sign. Tactics that push constant contact rarely work well."

ex still shows up,"it’s been almost ten months since my ex broke up with me and though i have been trying to move on and not look back, the smallest reminders of him make it difficult to do so. the biggest thing that has been hard to avoid is his social media. i stopped checking his account he’s literally private, but somehow the search engine on ig will still suggest his account. we haven’t interacted since the breakup, we don’t have shared mutuals, and hes a private account. i hate it bc anytime i type just one letter that’s included in his username his account will be suggested first. i don’t visit it and try to go on other accounts to avoid this happening but it just won’t work. it seems silly but it really doesn’t help that i still see him when im trying to avoid him. it’s like a door that just won’t stay shut. i don’t want to block him bc i just want to reach a level of indifference. i can’t help but to be tempted by visiting his account. i wish there was just a way to get rid of any reminder of him even those that are out of my control. ",2,1,2025-06-30 10:53:25,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo4glo/ex_still_shows_up/,,,So block the account? It’s obviously holding you back. You’re not going to reach a level of indifference if you have that consistent reminder and it knocks you back a few steps every time you see it.
How can you let go of love that still yearns for the person it used to call home?,"Where does love with nowhere to go, actually go? This love was never directed to me, but my ex. So now, what do I do with such love?

It’s Day 3 of my breakup. And almost 2 days of no contact at all. I can’t believe the more time passes, the less it hurts. I was grieving like a mad woman for 17 hours during Day 1. Then became emotionally fatigued and only cried for around an hour during Day 2. And today, I’ve only become teary-eyed since I had to be around family so I couldn’t cry. 

The piercing pain in my chest has definitely decreased, but only a little. I still wake up and go to sleep with a sharp pang whenever I’m reminded of our breakup. I still couldn’t eat properly. I think I’ve only eaten 2 and a half meals collectively since the breakup. Thinking about him still throws me into a spiral of missing him, reminiscing our memories, regretting my mistakes, and remembering why we had to breakup. But definitely, I am not wailing like I was during Day 1. I might wail like that again in the future, once I have recharged emotionally. But as of now, I am able to function at least a bit better compared to Day 1. 

I should be glad that the pain is lessening, even if only a little. But at the same time, it’s a gut wrenching reflection that our love and connection are also fading. I’m glad that Days 1-3 showed me that this pain is not forever. That as time goes on, I will soon be okay. But in exchange of that would be me losing the care and affection I used to have for my ex. That healing meant losing the space my ex used to hold.

I know I have to accept that the inevitable result of a breakup would be me and my ex drifting away physically and emotionally. But I used to treasure this love. I used to hold it close to my heart. It used to mean the world to me. And now, since we broke up, I have to let go of that love and let it fade away as just a memory in the past. Part of me wants to make this love a distant memory so that I could finally be okay. But another part of me wants to hold onto this love as a testament of the loving and wonderful 3 years that I spent with my ex. 

But how can I transform such profound love into something else? How can I make this love become something entirely different from the love I used to have for my ex, but also similar at the same time? Is there a way for me to heal and still hold space for the love and respect that I had for my ex—feelings that will not manipulate me into denying the breakup while still caring for him, albeit in a different way?

Honestly, I don’t even know if I should actually stop loving him as in have no more feelings for him at all. Or if I should just transform my love into something else. We broke up amicably while we still loved each other. We do not hate each other. So how I do move forward from a love so beautiful and compassionate that it was ended for the sake of my ex and I’s growth and future?

I want to heal from this breakup. I want to be okay. Like really okay. I want to stop hurting. But I’m also sad that I’m losing my connection with my ex. That I have to move on and stop caring for him. That the love I have for him no longer has a place to call home. Our love still lingers. I am in pain so that means I still love him. But it’s quite ironic that our love has also ceased to exist the moment we broke up.

Never been so down in my life,"Me (24m) and my ex (21f) broke up recently after a really toxic year-long relationship—both of us played a part in that.

When we first got together, things were amazing. She was utterly obsessed with me, and I was really into her—ESPECIALLY physically (actually we both were, I think we were both equally physically attracted to each other so was a bit of a jackpot), I thought she was absolutely stunning, and I think that’s a big reason I’m struggling to let go, I know it seems shallow but it’s true. 

Early on, I asked about her past (I’m a bit old-fashioned that way), and she gave me a number and even swore on her mum’s life (which may seem silly but actually meant something to me). Later, I found out in a horrible way she’d lied. It wasn’t the number that hurt—it was the broken trust, she cried and begged me not to leave so I stayed because I loved her.

After that, things got rocky. We argued constantly, and she lied about smaller things too which added to the hurt.

She was incredibly caring in other ways, but arguments would turn her into someone else. I also wasn’t perfect—I didn’t always communicate or respect her right, and I truly regret that.

Eventually, she ended things and it was the genuine breakup from hell. Almost immediately, she started seeing this guy she’d been seeing during our past breakup but left him and blocked him for me when we got back together. I know she probably feels justified how fast she got with someone because of how bad things got between us and her hatred for me now.

I’m stuck now wondering—was I too harsh? Should I have stayed and pushed through? I miss her constantly, even knowing how messy it all was.",1,2,2025-06-30 14:20:11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo8r9e/never_been_so_down_in_my_life/,,,"bro, this happens when emotions take over and there’s no room for reason, the same thing happened to me, the best thing is to distance yourself from that girl and move on, focus on training, self-improvement, connect with God and stuff like that, if you really want to get her back and if she’s ready to admit her mistakes, I can help you with some simple strategies, but honestly, I’m not sure how wise that is."
It stings… what would you do? Am i wrong?,"I got dumped about two weeks ago and she did me dirty just a quick phone call then blocked and the worse she left for someone who is way older (sugar daddy basically) and fat and ugly but has alot of money boats …etc i didn’t have any of that but i had a beautiful soul till she ruin everything by blaming me for cheating while i didn’t ( she actually did many times by talking to guys behind my back nothing physical except once we broke up before she went on a date made out with a guy i also cheated a couple of times just to make myself miss her) by not giving me space at all and wants constant daily attention by demanding to be out all the time it drained me financially and whenever i didn’t do that she punished me by being indifferent or distant or no sex i had a lil part in it by ignoring her during the week but gave her my full attention during the weekend i was just trying balance it. It hurts so much and its in my head am trying to get over it.. she expected me to chase or come back fix it like everytime this time i didn’t even thought i want am not able to face the fact she sold her body and everything between us just to have fun and money. What do you think guys should i reach out? 
She been liking those reels on IG hinting to reach out but also other posts that she is better with someone giving her money and degrading me in some ways like sayingyou want a house wife but u don’t have a house like saying you want a princess but u broke to give her princess treatment 
I reached out a couple of times through ig since its the only place am not blocked but unsent it instantly and i took her out of my followers list out of anger tbh yesterday i called from a different number she answered super ryt away and sounded exhausted my alil sad ( it was a Sunday afternoon) after two seconds i ended it o seem like a spam ",1,2,2025-06-30 14:15:28,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo8n4g/it_stings_what_would_you_do_am_i_wrong/,,,"What should you do?   If you want a house wife, get a house."
Just venting,"It hurts so much. I feel like all I did was trying to help them and somehow I got karma. Weirdest thing ever. Maybe this is a signal that they actually don't need me. They want me to stop thinking of them. They think lowly of me so please stop dream high? That I'm no use to them now that I can get tf out? I remember they didn't need much time to decide to kick me out of their life. I forget that they think relationship is transactional. Whenever I wish for them to comeback, I have bad lucks. Bad in very bad. It happens 3 times now. So I'm convinced that I shouldn't make that wish anymore unless I want to have a tough life. I read a book. It said I was like in a prison without sidewalls. I kept being in that. But I didn't really like that metaphor. Because to me inside or outside the prison, it's still the same thing. My hometown gets revamped. I don't recognize it now. People I love there are gone. Everything is almost gone. Do I think it gets better? I think it looks cleaner and more artificial. I don't know when the coast will be sold and covered by businesses. So it's really not much different between inside and outside the prison to me. I just go from one to another. Sometimes I just want to live alone and enjoy it, but my mom recently wants me to get married to have someone to take care of me... I don't remember my dad takes good care of her... I'm tired of the theory of finding someone to use them (not even mentioning creating someone to use them...). I feel like I'm very unlucky to be here at all. But I still want to live because I don't want to experience the near d*ath experience or very sick again. But it's not easy because people try to compete with me. I don't know what they're trying to achieve. There is no prize. I'm doing this sht because I want to find way to help people, not because I want to be ahead and all shiny. Wtf. If I want something glorious, I'm not fcking here. Maybe they see something that I don't see. Well, when things outside gets too hectic, I go back right here to the prison, going over some familiar feelings. But things are getting shattered I think. Life proves to me that I can't hack it and control it. Maybe others can but not me. Or I will later lol? I have things I want but I deny my wants so much that sometimes I don't recognize them.

Should I let her go or fight for her?,"There's all this back and forth I rattle with mentally about letting someone who you actually have a connection with go. Im a firm believer that two people who like each other if they are invested in making a relationship work, will (with a few caveats in there). 

I have been out of a toxic marriage for 18 months, didnt realise how stuck in a trauma bond I was, still in contact with my ex. Met a new girl who I told that it wasnt an issue, that the ex and I were platonic friends. 

Yet as soon as the ex found out she got jealous. It was like the access was limited and my attention had shifted. This is true it did, to the new girl. Only then did I know that I needed to start limiting communication with the ex. Still thinking it was healthy, I asked for more space, and less calls. I was more direct on the calls as well, speaking about only necessary things. 

When I realised just how unhealthy keeping the ex around was I overshared everything with the new girl, after 5 weeks of dating (yeah shit). 

New girl feels mis-lead, and that I specifically left out key details to ensure that she didnt feel threatened, and like the situation was better than it actually was. In reality the situation changed so rapidly I was trying to balance both at the same time. Notably realising I needed to cut communication with the ex, it finally happened. 

The new girl feels lied to and deceived, I didnt intentionally do this, I chose to share what I was vulnerable with because I was still working through my issues. She knew I was still in contact with the ex, the frequency is what made her uncomfortable. Understandably overwhelmed, hurt and her trust felt broken, she asked for time and space. 

Should I reach out to her and tell her I want to work on things if she is open to talking?  We had an amazing connection and spent 3-4 times per week together ever since reconnecting. I dont want her to feel like she was deprioritised or like I had an alterior motiv, I had a trauma I knew about bubble to the surface at the wrong time, and I hurt her, badly.

Make her miss you and, if you haven't done anything serious, she'll come back. ||| Bro, I feel you so much on this. I had a similar thing — my ex left me because of trust issues and I thought explaining more and more would fix it, but it only pushed her away more. The only thing that helped me fix myself and get her back was actually giving her the space she asked for. No calls, no chasing — just real no contact and working on myself for real. Sounds simple but it’s harder than it looks. If she still cares, the space will pull her back. Just wanted to share what worked for me. Stay strong, man."
5 months into breakup,"I am slowly starting to get convinced to start giving other men a chance. Up until recently, the idea made me recoil with fear. What if he changed his mind and I have started something new. I didn’t want to break someone’s heart, because I knew I am not over him. But by the looks of it, I stopped existing for him the minute he decided to let me go, and I need to start giving guys who are pursuing me a chance, otherwise I will remain stuck in the same place. 

Is it wrong to try dating again even though he’s still in the back of my mind? I’m not obsessing over him or anything, but he’s still there in some form or another.

But PLEASE let your dates know that you are NOT over your ex! And please try to keep things casual. If you do start to develop feelings for a new guy, take a step back and tell him that you need to take a break for a while. Then do some introspecting and decide if you are ready or not. ||| Depends. I thought I was over things with my wife after 5 months. 6 months later she asked me if I would consider reconciling and everything came flooding back pretty quickly. I ended up making someone very angry in the process. ||| you don’t need to be 100% over someone to move forward   you just need to stop living in the version of life where they come back  date if it’s curiosity   not if it’s distraction   if you’re honest and grounded, you won’t break hearts   you’ll just find yours again ||| I’m personally going through something similar. We broke up 4 months ago. Around a month into our breakup she already had a new partner. In my case I have been trying here and there but my heart is still so full of her I don’t seem to be able to love someone else properly yet. Recently I had to somewhat break a girl’s heart because she really wanted to formalize something with me, so I was honest with her and myself, and told her that I didn’t had the tools to love her properly, and that I would end up hurting her.   You don’t have to wait for your ex to come back to you, don’t wait on something that might never occur, instead take this time to heal properly, so you might have the tools to have a healthy relationship in the future. Don’t enter a relationship if you aren’t over your ex entirely. You don’t want to hurt someone just because you aren’t clear about what you want right now.   I don’t want to entirely discourage you from the idea of your ex coming back, as it is a fantasy that despite everything I still hold very tightly to my chest, but nothing has hurt me more than seeing the person I swore I’d marry move on with their lives so easily, and it’s a kind of pain I’d never swore on anyone. So if I have an advice for you it would be just to heal properly first, and everything else will come naturally afterwards. Keep it up! ||| That's a tough one , 😔. I wish I had an answer. Listen to your heart. ||| from experience, i felt the same way, and my ex i was waiting for did come back while with another guy, and i ended up hurting the guy i was with. don’t risk it until you’re not waiting for him to come back ||| I started going on dates only 3 months after my breakup. Luckily I’m moving states in August so I let everyone know ahead of time I’m not looking for anything serious. I felt I started too soon but 5 months seems like it would be enough time if he is completely gone. Start slow and dip your toes in with dating apps/talking to people in person more. I think it will help you move forward. You don’t want to get stuck ruminating on your ex for too long. ||| I wouldn’t give, but I’m a romantic who believes in “true love” ||| I think if you were to communicate that to anyone new it should be fine. tell them about where you stand in the process of moving on.   But, if you know that you will accept him back in case he hits you up, then you will break your own and another persons heart.  Id say the main factor here is where you stand, do you want to keep the door open or do you want to shut it down completely. ||| Easy question hard answer Let's say you start something new and he pops right back up at the worst time ever. Would you jump to his arms back?  Im talking as a dumpee and as someone that his  soul is damaged, part of me says that I'd drive 200mp/h to her just to hug her again  The other part of me tells me ""wtf? She caused you this much agony in the breakup? Left you like you were nothing? Was cold as hell even after 9 months of warm love? What's wrong with you? You turn over the other cheek or something?""  Idk really. I'd put my efforts in finding a suitable guy, someone who doesn't see you as an option.  I was clear to her, I sent her a long message - after long consideration, I don't want a relationship with just a girl - I want a relationship with YOU. I repeated it like three time on different occasions.  She didn't seem to care.  Good luck with her next relationship i guess(?!) And mine as well... now I need to find another girl to give her the world. The only thing I want in life really, is to make my next girlfriend happy and smile.  And if she smiles without me, then so be it I made my job, in the other way around but still...  :("
Is this normal?,"Over the course of my (28F) relationship of almost 4 years with my ex (28M) I have emotionally checked out. There were some red flags I kept ignoring because he was always a bit ""weird"" as people described him and I was convinced he is a bit autistic, or at least an introvert or something neurodivergent idk. 

Anyway, a few months prior to our breakup I started avoiding intimacy and wasnt excited about going out together or anything anymore. This made me feel incredibly guilty, especially since I couldnt wrap my mind around the fact that I cant even try anymore to feel something. Especially since it was time to plan our housing, we got steady jobs finally and potentially marriage and kids and so on.... 

I talked with him about how I feel. He dismissed it at first, then I said I should at least get my mind clear and I started going to therapy praying my therapist would just say Im afraid of conmitment or that I am anxious and anxiety is spilling all over my relationship and potential changes. Ofc, the therapist said nothing. Then I wanted to seperate, move out. He still didnt believe me until the day I said I have found a new place to stay, and then he wanted to talk about all of it, he listened to me and wanted me to stay, to give it one more try.

I explained, honestly, that I have lost feelings and its been bothering me for quite some time. And I was hoping therapy would help me find out the reason for that. I told him Im usually anxious, so it could be just fear of changes or it could be that I hold some resentment because of how rude he was to some of my friends and sister and how we never really resolve our fights because of his pettiness.
Whatever the reason, I couldnt bring myself to feel again and that we shouldnt stay together since it would just be wasting even more time. He should find someone who wont overthink the whole relationship for so long like I did.

He thinks he is not a petty person and that I love him, that Im just scared of commitment. He started saying that to all our friends when I moved out and when some of them wouldnt agree, he would insult them.We broke up with me saying I dont love him anymore and him saying Im wrong and that he knows me better than I do myself, and its all just anxiety, that he would like to be friends and also smthng like a therapist to me whenever I want. I cut off contact because it was all overwhelming all of a sudden but a week after he contacted me as a friend and asked for cup of coffee, when I refused, he told me I should just block his number since I have no intention of hanging out or talking. I refused because I thought he is just saying that out of spite and because he is hurting, but he insisted saying it would make things easier for him. So I blocked him. 

He started hanging out w our friends more and telling everyone how Im a coward and so on, started drinking, took a sick leave on his work for some time. He started having some heated arguments w friends who refused to find out for him how im doing and it got to a point where those friends came to me to cry about how he treated them when they were just trying to be there for him. Somehow, he also hacked my socials and found my diary from 5 years ago and my old photos and was spewing shit about me to everyone and making a case about who I actually am and how we r meant to be while also hating on me on some other occasions etc. Some friends advised to get the restraining order or smthng, but I convinced them thats just how he deals with stuff that he is not dangerous.

Now, I know he is hurting. I was his first long term relationship, he was and prolly still is - grieving. But.. Isnt all this behaviour just confirming that his red flags werent just him being inherently weird OR is it normal to behave like this when youre hurting too much? Im different and I cant understand this kind of behaviour, my sadness and my anger usually look aaalot different, im at my worst just self destructive, not an asshole. But I did hear about people having a horrible time doing horrible things after breakups and then after some time and healing, being completely different people. 

Its been a year since then, I bumped into him recently and he still gives that vibe like he is going to smash some walls any second or burn the whole town. 

He loved me and I couldnt love him back and I couldnt accept him the way he is. The more I learned about him, the less I felt. I would never want to have kids w him and would never trust him to not snap in front of our kids and I honestly think he is immature. But he NEVER treated ME the way he treated our friends and my sister. 

Im still failing to understand how he could be so golden to me and yet so snappy with others. After the breakup, the hell just broke loose.

 Is this his real self or is he just grieveing???
Is he just immature and will change or is he just an asshole?? Does he have mental issues or just bad at coping w emotions??? 

Its been really hard for me to tell which is which and the thought I ruined a good soul and stunted someones emotional growth is eating me inside. I feel the need to one more time try to tell him I do not love him and he should just let it go and stop torturing himself and everyone around him. He couldnt listen before cause he was hurting, but he would understand now?? Friends tell me not to contact him in any way. 

I think theyre right. But Im so anxious to the thought I might bump into him again and he just snaps at me or that he is gonna talk shit to some of my collegues as well just to get my attention. 

I would be at peace if I knew he is not going to come back at me somehow or do something insanely stupid or dangerous. 

Please, advice.

And sorry for so many words.",1,2,2025-06-30 14:06:23,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo8fd8/is_this_normal/,,,"People confuse a persons “true colors” with how they act after a breakup. The person you’ve met 4 years ago is very well still the same person he is today. The difference is that when somebody is truly hurt and they’ve lost something very dear to them, you’ll find that they will act out poorly, resort to unhealthy coping mechanisms. I’m a man, and when I’m in a relationship with a girl, that’s the person I protect and value very much. I put all my effort into her, and I do my best to keep growing. Relationships are all about growing together and in this modern world we live in, people see red flags and tend to run away in hopes they find what they’re looking for later down the line. The reality is that nobody’s going to ever be perfect, and we’re all going to have flaws that we must live with. It truly does take teamwork and a team based effort to pull off a long term relationship.   Assuming you weren’t looking for a commitment to begin with then it’s best to leave him if he wanted something different. However do know that people act out in many different ways due to unfortunate events. Especially those that directly affect them.   My best advice is to look at your relationship as a whole for what it is. It’s a 4 year relationship. Just know that 3 years in is when you start to learn things you don’t like in a person and people start to doubt their relationship. You need to ask yourself. Anxiety aside, your mind aside, and all the external factors aside and without any contradictions do you love this person deep down in your heart? If the answer is yes then I would recommend to both sit down in person and hear each others side and come to a resolution. If the answer is no then I would suggest to call it quits."
Should i even reclaim a hobby that now feel unsafe because of my ex?,"I am i guess what you would call anxiety attached but with probably a trauma component that I'm trying to figure out in therapy.

I found a lot of joy in 2024 in playing TCGs. But end of last year i started dating a woman that pursued me and left her boyfriend for me, with both of them being part of the very small scene i am in. A lot of traumatic event followed, she was going back to him then to me then to him again and i took her back every time. He spread rumors, verbally assaulted me and threatened me when he found me at her house one afternoon, her and i had also had an abortion. And she was regularly very aggressive and disrespectful when i tried to put boundaries.

So i finally got the courage, probably months too late, to cut all bridges with them, except i still want to play the hobby. I am on sick leave and feel a lot better, but the TCG space feels unsafe and contaminated. I lost a friend that is also part of the hobby and doesn't speak to me anymore because she was tired of me talking about the drama.

Now i've been dabbling into either subscribing to events where neither of them are (rare) or attend and feel miserable and anxious and leaving early most of the time. Registering online and seeing their name can sometimes be enough for me to have an anxiety attack and start shaking. They went back together the day after i cut ties with her of course.

Should i completely give up the hobby, or fight for it? i made my peace with the relationship being over and mentally i know all i need to know but it seems my nervous system is traumatized and i don't know if i should prioritize safety or courage.

i still can’t get over him,"hi i wrote on here a few months ago talking about trying to get over my ex even though we had barely broken up but it’s been a good 3 months (almost 4)  
and i still can’t get over him. 


it’s so weird, i genuinely don’t wanna be with him again because i don’t wanna make him feel shitty like i did last time. i feel so much guilt for ruining us, he was perfect for me and i just ruined it because i was selfish and wanted my own life and wouldn’t talk to him for hours. i don’t rlly know/remember why we specifically broke up but i know that was one reason. we would never get along at some points too because me and him had not so good communication skills, but i can tell he tried and i did too but at one point i gave up. 

i also was very much loud about our problems and would rant to anyone i could about it because it would make me mad and i needed to hear advice from someone that wasn’t him, and i’m pretty sure my ex best friend told him this because it was her and her friends i would rant to LOL

anyways i just want him gone from my memories and it’s so HARD. he doesn’t even love me nor care about me anymore and wants nothing to do with me, and i keep bothering him and texting him just to hear him and talk to him. i’ve tried everything and it’s always a little reminder of him, even my own birthday is a reminder of him since our first date was on my birthday and i cried in his arms listening to August 10 by Julie Doiron, and it’s so fucking annoying i’ve literally tried to attempt so i could just shut my brain off and stop thinking all together. i just want my old self back i just want peace i just want him gone from my fucking life ",3,2,2025-06-30 08:00:05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo1tcc/i_still_cant_get_over_him/,,,"If you’ve not made progress in nearly 4 months, then that is a clear sign of an emotional blockage.

One part of me really wants to try again but another part is telling me that that's a horrible idea. I don't know if you'll even be welcomed back by friends and family and i really wish i could just go back in time to when we were good and in love.

Fucked up a nice relationship due to being too obsessive,"I (22M) had a beautiful relationship with (21F) but I messed it up due to being too anxious. In the beginning of our relationship it was chill as I had few friends whom I used to hang out with regularly but after a point due to work pressure and family expectations, I got too attached to her constantly asking for her validation and support which may look rosy in the beginning but actually develops a kind of codependency that is not healthy.
The week before our breakup she was going through stuff because of her career issues and wanted to not talk for a few days, but me being the anxious partner took it on my self worth and kept constantly begging her to talk when she clearly wasn’t in the mood so. Eventually my anxiety grew so much that I was not able to function properly without talking to her and she had to cut chords for that. I know I could have been a good partner but my anxiety created such an environment that I wasn’t able to do what my brain wanted to.
P.S. I am getting therapy for this but probably I would never be able to forgive myself for ruining the bond.",1,5,2025-06-30 13:43:52,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo7vvq/fucked_up_a_nice_relationship_due_to_being_too/,,,"You didn’t fuck up a nice relationship. As much as you loved that person, you gotta remember it’s a team based effort. And relationships are all about learning one another.

As much as you may find her attractive you need to ask yourself if she is somebody you’d wish to spend your life with.

If you wanna talk, hit a DM man. ||| This is basically why my boyfriend broke up with me. I just couldn’t help it. I needed his validation and I needed communication and I was too anxious"
He Suddenly broke up,"Im f19 and he is m21. We were in a long distance relationship but we have met once. We have been together since a year and our families were involved. I have talked to his mom, she really liked me, i have talked to his sister-in-law and i have her on my instagram and snapchat. His father and brother knows about me. Some of the extended family knew as well. Even my family knew about him but because im just 19 they said to focus on my career as well, they didnt dislike him but just wanted me to focus on myself. 

Everything was perfect during the whole relationship. We had a few fights but we solved them within ours and were back together loving each other. The most healthy and happy couple you can think of. Always open with communication. We had our boundaries, not having opposite gender friends, etc and we both were totally happy with it.

Suddenly yesterday he started picking a fight, that my family doesn't support him. He is very gullible, got influenced a few times by his friends and started a fight with me. So he was trying to argue about my family thing. I have explained him many times its not because of him but because of my age. Also i come from a broken family so its difficult. We had a fight yesterday and today morning he Suddenly started talking about the ""future"".

We both have always talked about our future, how we will get married, we will have 1 biological kid and adopt 1 (my wish), have a dog in our cute tiny home. He has a business so he can't shift so i always assured him that ill shift to your city and country after getting married. Even his parents have many times pinched the topic of marriage with me.

Today he said that his parents won't be okay with this marriage. Im starting my bachelors in a couple of weeks, and i wanna get into research so my education will take 8 9 years. My parents have told me that i can get married only at 28. His parents said 25. Still i and him discussed that we will figure it out.

Suddenly he told me that his parents aren't okay with waiting, and adopting a kid. I told him i can't marry this young ofcourse. Then he started saying that family comes first, even you know that (i dont believe in blood and he knows that) so I disagreed. I said im not asking you to leave your parents or fight them, just let them know that we will need to wait. I told him we have many years in our hands we will manage together but he was repeating that his family won't be okay with waiting. 

Suddenly he said that i won't get a job anyways, he said you won't get a job after bachelors, or masters, or even phd, maybe after doing something else you might get. He himself has just completed highschool and got into his father's business.

I got really pissed and agreed that okay we won't adopt a kid and we can get married during my phd. He just said he doesn't wanna do long distance. He said he realized in a year that long distance is hard. But im shifting near him for 3 years for my bachelors, he still said no no and gave me no real response. 

I really trusted him and thought we will get married cause our families were involved. So i shared my intimate pictures last month and we have been actively s_xting since 2 months. I was really hurt cause it was my first time and i felt used now that he is leaving me. He said that he ""didn't force me anyways"" ""you didnt even let me save them, they were in once view"". And i got pissed even more.

I really don't like being disrespected so i got emotionally de-attached for that moment. I broke up with him and started removing our online instagram memory accoun of just us two, gcs of just us 2 with cute names. He then texted me saying that he thinks i wanted this breakup all along, im acting so chill. I literally called him 17 times, and he didn't pick up any call, i was crying my eyes out then. He said that he didn't do anything wrong and he is thinking of his and my future. He doesn't wanna live in this insecurity.

Then he started blaming me randomly, saying that i broke his trust by liking (double tapping) a guy's text message in my college gc. And that once he saw a guy's username in my search bar. He said im a ""danger"" to his trust. I realized that he is feeling guilty and is trying to trick himself and me into thinking that im the villian so i called him out and he started saying that no i didnt do anything wrong, i know you are emotional so im doing this for you. 


I just dont understand how he can change so much in a single day. We were perfect yesterday morning, he started that fight in the evening and today evening we broke up. What can be the reason? Did i do the right thing by breaking up or did i over react? I really loved him, im just speechless.",1,0,2025-06-30 13:43:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo7vus/he_suddenly_broke_up/,,3 year(s),
Should I reach out,"Sorry for long post skip to lasp paragraph for question.



My ex (we were eachothers most serious relationship, talking about marriage, kids, etc.) hit me up after 5 months of no contact, she said it was to see how I was doing but I got the sense it was for sex (call late at night, later foundbout she was thinking about me because of a bar we frequented and a bathroom we hooked up in).  Well we talked a little and then started having sex.  I started to feel love on both sides etc but she also just started seeing a guy 29 years older then her.  Besides the gap this guy had been trying to offer her a job as his college coaching assistant months back tried to get with her she said so lots of bad there.  She told him she wasnt looking for a relationship and she and i hooked up again then told me she was in a ""situationship"". I messed up, good intentions bad action, and she was pissed at me for a bit but mostly resolved it. We hooked up a couple more times and there was a maddening mix of feeling like she loved me one night and wanted nothing to do with me the next. 



 One night during sex she told me she was mine, all all mine and no one elses.  Well after being left on read for a bit i called to try and set up an evening to go out and she didnt seem to want to talk to me nor set something up.  Then 2 days later she sent me a pic of her in the previously mentioned bathroom saying ""guess which bathroom"".  So she was wanting to hook up and I headed over.  I got there and noticed she only recently removed a picture she had of us on her wall down, asked her about it and she tossed the photo 2 days ago so i figured and that guy was now coming over to her place.  Later i brought that up and she was pissed because she thought I was stalking her but no just power of observation (removed photo and cleaned kitched same day + reaction)  She said ""my relationship is none of your business""



  I could tell she was down about something and she made a comment about cant believing the state of her life. I asked her for a no bs answer to if she cared about me or hated me and she said ""part of me still loves you and cares about you"". I have been working really hard on myself since our initial breakup almost a year ago and an area messed up was trying to fix her/her problems when she talked about them instead of listen/support her.  So i brought that to let her know my realization so she could talk to me if she wanted but then at that she started going off on me about something else i did wrong.  It led to an arguement, i have changed and learned a lot and wouldnt make the same mistakes that were detriment to our relationship before, she would bring up those mistakes and say ""this isnt it. Were not getting married"" Etc. But because she brought up the problem areas that wouldnt be a problem if we tried again I brought up how itd wouldnt be like that and wed have all the best parts and more if we tried.  She angrily told me to get over it, move on, etc. My therapist told me she was gas lighting me (she did at least once for sure) and manipulating me etc.  She was taking shots at me all night and not talking about her own issues/failures like always and i got sick of it so brouht up how damn confusing the last couple weeks had been and then the gas lighting/manipulaton.  I did so to ask her if that was what she was doing but before i could ask if that was the case she told me to leave.  I tried to explain and turn the conversation back to no avail, there was anger on both sides her mentioning going no contact even deleting numbers and me pushing the door closed a bit hard.

  
Due to our past (majority not mentioned) and how she has operated i didnt know what she really wanted but i get it now.  She was only using me for great sex and im not ok with that espescially because of the other factors primarily i still love her and shes involved with someone even if thats all kinds of bad.  Knowing that i can start to let her go but i wish we didnt part in anger, should i try to reach out and say something about that or not?",1,0,2025-06-30 13:37:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo7qoj/should_i_reach_out/,,,

"Ex randomly blocked me on Instagram, but not WhatsApp. Why now?","I’m 34 male, ex 33 female. 

Messy break-up end of April while travelling together in the US for two months. 1 week from the end of our trip. 

She walked out on me after a horrible blazing row. I had reached the end of the tether with her self-centredness, bad attitude and lack of accountability. She was in perpetual victim mode and would never have a conversation if I dared express any frustration with her shitty behaviour. 

A few days went by at the end of travelling and she reached out over Instagram and said she’s happy for me having a good time in my last week alone. I responded and she ignored me, I thought weird but whatever. Nonetheless I wished her a safe flight home and she thanked me. 

Got back to the UK she commented on a couple of my stories and again said she’s happy for me. Mid May she gave me a call a few days later “checking in” only to then tell me a part of her misses and loves me but a part of her feels unsafe with me and she feels “traumatised” from my behaviour the last night. Literally ridiculous she just couldn’t take accountability and resorted to crying and screaming like usual. Perpetual victim who was having therapy for childhood trauma and doesn’t get on with half her family. I did know about the red flags and her entitled behaviour.  She went onto say she doesn’t want to keep in contact after this call so I wondered, well why the fuck even call me then? 

One week went by and I messaged her just forwarding on some stuff contacts in the US sent me as I thought I should share. Unsurprisingly no response. Whatever then. 

One month since, I’ve been busy working and stopped looking at her insta stories and I barely post on there. She posted something the other day about being heartbroken after 7 weeks in America and now 7 weeks on feels in a good energy again. Then weirdly this weekend I was thinking about her and was tempted to her ask her for some photos she took that I wanted for my blog, but I left it. Then my mate called yesterday and randomly started asking me about her and if I’d heard from her or she blocked me and I said no to both. Just no contact. Then so weirdly after the call I found out she’d literally just blocked me last night! But just on Instagram not WhatsApp. And I’m just wondering, why? Is she still after two months, mad with me? She said in our last call that she doesn’t hate me but I hate her. Not true, I really don’t feel that strongly, I wish the best for her. But why this random block? Is she trying to get a reaction, or is she just trying to move on and have some privacy? I find it a bit strange. She blocked me once before and unblocked me days later, but this is different for sure. 

She still talks (rarely) to both her previous exes (they live in different countries) and she always told me she likes to stay in contact with exes on good terms. Of course we had a different relationship ending though as I called out her shitty behaviour a lot. She always said she liked that about me but turns out she couldn’t handle a guy who wasn’t a doormat like her exes. She must really hold a grudge and honestly we both taught each other a lot, I’d stay friends with her and let bygones be bygones but why reach out she’ll just ignore me anyway….

Ex blocked me on Instagram, but not on WhatsApp. Later I found out she was visiting some friends in the city I live in. She also asked her friend to hide the stories from me.   She hasn't healed or forgot about you. I guess she cares more than she would like to admit. And is afraid that the see some of her posts."
Quick question for everyone here,"So I’ve broken up with my ex for about a year and 7 months now. She dumped me because she thought I wasn’t gonna change but truth is I just was busy working full time and school full time trying to be an engineer. I listened to her but wasn’t consistent enough but she made it clear from the beginning health was priority. But I tried to be the perfect boyfriend. Not just any boyfriend I was her emotional shield, career mentor, safe space, and day one supporter. I gave her my mind, my time, my energy, and my heart. She dumped me and then after 4 months she was with someone else. That’s fine. I go no contact for maybe 9-10 months. She calls me from a new number and we get to start talking. Truth is I never really moved on from her I really loved her and thought maybe we could make it work. But she was still in a relationship so screw it she wanted to be friends and I made the mistake of being like cool. I made it clear I had feelings for her still but never went out my way to beg her or anything just played cool. We’ve known each other for 3 yrs and recently her daughter graduated from school and I wanted to celebrate it because I genuinely cared about the kid and when we were dating accepted her as my own. I asked her politely would it be okay with her if I brought flowers and a card for her kid just to put a smile on her and make her day. She said that’s fine. So I asked what time would it be okay I would just simply drop it off and and leave she said this weekend I gotta visit my dad. Message me Sunday. I message her again Sunday night and she is like oh I’m actually not ny right now I’m outside of ny I appreciate you some bs. She wasn’t visiting her dad but was with her current man. My thing is first of all, you could have said you were gonna somewhere with your mans outside of ny I would have been fine with it. But to lie for no reason doesn’t make any sense. My intent wasn’t to find an opportunity to sneak back into your life, it was purely because I wanted to make child’s day. I know I’m dumb for even keeping contact with my ex but how many people experience pathological liars with their significant other?",1,0,2025-06-30 13:26:27,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo7hik/quick_question_for_everyone_here/,,,
She fell out of love,"My girlfriend and I of 2 and 1/2 years just broke up. She told me last night after a fairly successful conversation that she wanted to break up because she ""fell out of love,"" but she also said she still loves me in a different way. I don't really know what to make of this.

For some months she has been treating me pretty poorly with a lot of ignoring me and invalidating how I felt about what she has done and just my feelings in general. She has been uncommunicative and distant and unapologetic and all that crap, while I feel I've been a pretty good partner. I have been working on codependency because, I mean, you can probably tell that I'm really codependent, but still I have been hiding it and being a good partner. I started to resent her, but I still love her and I'm really sad about breaking up. I don't know what to do with myself. 

Again, she told me she fell out of love, but she still likes me. She said there isn't another person and I kinda asked her to reiterate that a few times. She apologized for how she has treated me and that stuff, but bleh. She also said we can be friends and we could play games sometime n stuff and I think I would like that. I don't know though, I don't know how I can just move on from this. A lot of her explanations for how she's felt are ""I don't know"" and ""It's complicated"" so it just sucks! it really sucks!
I don't use Reddit all that often, but I just really need to get my feelings out. Thank you for reading 

edit: we are both evil women that were in an evil liberal agenda relationship or whatever lol... i wish i didnt feel this sorrowful like things we're my fault and i wish i could get over it. i feel pathetic and i wish i would stop crying over someone who hurt me repeatedly ",35,38,2025-06-29 18:07:27,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnlasi/she_fell_out_of_love/,,,"i can relate. gf of 3.5 years broke up with me over the same reason. like someone else said, she got bored and thinks she can do better. if you genuinely are a good guy and treated her well, reality is she probably won’t find better and will regret it sooner or later. i’ve come to realize when people “fall out of love”, they aren’t ready to settle down and have some maturing to do. it fucking sucks loving someone who doesn’t love you but you’ll get through it. i’m almost 3 months from the break up and i’m feeling a lot better than i did the first month. ||| As someone who’s been discarded the same way, I can only say it’s bc they think they can do better than you. She just got bored of how well the relationship was going she needed some dopamine sheesh. Falling out of love is a genuine thing for people if they’re either mistreated or well treated so it’s your pick. ||| There’s another guy. She loves you, but she loves someone else more. That’s what’s going on more than likely. No one gives away a thousand dollars for nothing. Someone may give away a thousand dollars if they get 2 thousand somewhere else though. ||| You had probably become too clingy and she felt more like she was chasing a child than a man. What you can do is simple: absolutely no contact, no messages, no calls, nothing. And don't accept any form of friendship from her. And don't appear weak or needy. Try to make your life more interesting and independent: start going out with friends again, find new ones, do sports, hobbies... if you haven't done anything serious you'll see that sooner or later she'll come back. If you do things well, in my opinion, you'll feel the effects within a couple of months. ||| Same thing happened to me, it’s really hard and I’m still in shock and confused on how did the happen and why ||| This is not as complicated as you think.  1. the relationship is over.  2. she is open to being just friends with you.  3. But she is not interested in having that friendship ever develop back into a romantic relationship.  It really doesn't matter if she can't articulate her exact feelings or her exact reasons. All you need to know is what I wrote above. ||| Theres another guy ||| The spark just left and she got bored probably. It's not a you problem, it's just you two were not meant for each other. Just move on and don't take it personal, it's common a lot and happens to a lot of people in relationships ||| I was dumped exact same way mate and she said I love you and and value you but not in relationship way I am lost rn I understand you and wanna knkw what will happen between you may the force be with you mate ||| This is pretty common in modern dating. These girls are told their whole life how pretty/special etc. they are.  They think they are a 10/10 and options are unlimited and don’t want to settle thinking men 10x better are right around the corner.  The disillusion from reality is spread through lots of social media content telling them to have “fun”.  It won’t last.  Then they’ll hit “The Wall”.  It will come with no warning as they parade through life.  Then it’s too late.  Their options dwindle as they ask “Where are all the men?”.  She had you all along.  This rhetoric is tough to swallow.  You’ll recover, build up your life, make money, get emotionally grounded and become a magnet.  Be strong brother!"
"My ex doesn't think he's been toxic. So, here's a list I can use to remind myself that he was sometimes.","1. The first time he kissed me, I'd explicitly asked him not to kiss me. He argued that we'd been physically close in other ways and that it was unreasonable of me to expect him not to kiss me. I hadn't consented to it. He crossed and then argued about my very clear boundary. 

2. He once said that Gazans should just be absorbed into other Arab countries and that the strip of land they were on wasn't worth anything anyway. It was just dirt and not valuable, totally denying that it's home for the people who live there. (For context, I'm Middle Eastern and he's white and both of us were raised in the U.S.) However you feel about the issue, the complete lack of empathy was shocking. 

3. He broke up with me once last year because he thought that the reason why I'd had a falling out with a guy friend must have been because I'd dated him and we'd broken up. It wasn't. We'd had a fading away more than a falling out because he'd hinted at more and I hadn't wanted more. This was before my ex and I had even really started dating. I'd told him about it. 

4. After we broke up, he sent a letter to my aunt (who he'd never met) because he thought I needed ""help."" He shared my private messages and voicemails to him with her. He outed my other ex to her and my family and nearly outed me in the process. (I didn't need help, by the way. I think he could feel me pulling away.) 

5. I told him not to contact my friends or family again. He did, twice. And he shared an email where I'd poured my heart out to him, and more. 

6. While we were working on our relationship, he was involved with multiple other women and lied by omission. He now says he never lied to me and is trying to rewrite history while accusing me of doing that. 

7. He suggested mental health diagnoses for me that he knew would hurt me. (No, he's not a therapist.) He shared his therapist's suggested diagnosis for me with me. His therapist told him he shouldn't do that, and criticized him (told him he weaponizes his intellect). He quit therapy after that. 

8. After we broke up, he reported my posts on r4r-type subs even though they were following the rules to try to get them taken down. I'm also fairly certain he reported my dating profile, though he claims he didn't. He tracks my Reddit activities and sometimes tries to shut me down. I'm sure he's telling lies to do that. He may even find this post, even though it's a new account. 

9. One time, I said I hadn't heard of this small private school and asked him how he knew it (thinking perhaps he or a friend had some connection to it) and his response was a snarky, ""I read."" (For the record, I also try to read and stay on top of things but I don't know everything.)

10. He was incredibly judgmental of others. I realized later that it was because he's incredibly sensitive to criticism. Yet he'd say I was the judgmental one. That one took me longer -- I realized he was projecting. 

11. He is a terrible driver. The third worst driver I've seen. In the two years we were together, he accidentally ran multiple red lights and stop signs. I was always hesitant to give him too much feedback because of how mopey he'd get. 

12. It became clear to me that he thought he was too smart for most people. He didn't have a job for years because he couldn't figure out what he wanted (he was well off enough to not need a job). He wanted to help the world and...did absolutely nothing. Didn't volunteer, didn't do anything part-time. Just read and took walks. It sounds like a nice life until you realize how sad and lonely it is. 

13. He would accuse me of things I hadn't done and then, when proven wrong, move on like nothing had happened. 

14. He would sometimes try to make me believe that I hadn't felt certain ways or done certain things for reasons I believed. When we were together and after we broke up. 

15. Once, he pressured me into taking a health supplement I didn't want to take. It made my heart's rhythm go off pace and I felt awful. 

16. I just generally never felt like I was smart enough to be with him. He claimed he loved my mind but then judged others in such a way that made me feel like there was no way he could mean it. That's on me, mostly. I was too insecure. 

17. After we broke up, he'd sometimes give me the silent treatment if I didn't say something he liked. I felt pressured to say certain things just so that he'd talk to me so that we could keep working on our relationship. 

18. Most of his few friends are his exes. He couldn't understand why I didn't want to meet them. I was his first relationship to last more than a few months (he's 41). Still, he described some of them as being intense. 

19. He once told me he'd leave me if I got an abortion. This is mostly just an incompatibility, but it still hurt. 

20. Most of my past relationships were pretty normal and ended for the usual reasons: incompatibilities, distance, etc. I was in two abusive relationships, one when I was young. He once said I like to find abusive men and be in those kinds of relationships. (Which I don't, but if that we're even true, then what does that say about him?) This is also with him knowing I'd dealt with abuse growing up and knowing that the person in the first abusive relationship had raped me. I definitely didn't ask for that. 

There's probably more. Some of these are toxic and emotionally abusive, some are just red flags and poor emotional boundaries. 

I made mistakes as well, and there were good times, too. Of course there were. I used to love him so much. But when I reflect, I wish I hadn't met him. It would have been better for both of us.

This got me inspired to do the same with my ex ahaha ||| Men who approach you correctly will never turn around and be demonic in nature towards you. A man’s approach is everything because it tells you what kind of man he is.   Most men will put you through a-lot and write it off not because they make mistakes it’s because they know exactly what they are doing.   You don’t need to explain any of this to him he knows and just don’t care he will simply find another victim to drain.   Your job is to make sure you understand where you went wrong and why you put up with so much.   He sounds like my ex of two years that I just dumped. The ones who pretend to be good are worser than the bad ones. Atleast with the bad ones you can see it coming. The only thing about him wrong was the approach.

Or you’ll just forget they did it, as time goes on.  Gotta write it down or you’ll let them hurt you worse than they did the first time."
HOW CAN I LET GO OF YOU,"The day I started letting go of you was when the idea of us was sure to exist,

 in my mind, in every way.

I had to let you down;

 the sweet reality of us and the bitter reality of me never held hands.

 Funny enough, I started making the surety of us into the wounded child.

She giggled, for she was down for every possibility of us.

Wounded children never dream, for the hope of dreaming caused them a lifetime of not achieving it.

They yearn, they beg, they never let go, they never move on.

When we both nodded, you were nowhere to be seen.

That's when you let go of us.

 

When reality of us not existing surfaced, the wounded child yearned and begged for you.

But this time, I didn't give her what she wanted, for I have loved you enough to let you go.

Her tantrums grew; in your absence, the need for you grew.

That's how she was conditioned.

She can't see what's right in front of her, but something light years away. That explains why she loved the sky so dearly.

She ran, ran to the arms of people who wounded her.

But this time, I took her pinky and asked, “what if I stayed this time?”

The bewilderment sprung on her face.

 She looked at me as if I am a clown who jumped out of the box, shocked by my words and my clowness.

 

She still needed ears for her cries, so I gave her mine and the people of whom I care.

Her cries were haunting. Her wails echoed through my mind, leaving me unable to function.

She demanded to know the reason for your leaving.

You never gave any, so I had to make her many.

 Out of which bloomed anger and hatred for you.

Why did you choose to love me? Or did you ever love me?

Your fast assurance of your love for me was just your way of deluding yourself of your capability of loving another, only to realize you can't.

 

……And many more conclusions I made of you.",1,0,2025-06-30 13:13:28,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo7717/how_can_i_let_go_of_you/,,,
"15Months and she’s gone, but still loves me","I just want to say that if this sounds like ai , I’m gonna say that’s because it is … Haven’t had anyone to talk to apart from chat GPT … but this is what’s going on

We broke up on Friday. She did it over the phone. No big fight. No screaming. Just… quiet heartbreak. She told me she still loves me — and that’s what’s messing with my head the most.

How do you walk away from someone you love?

I know I’m not perfect, but I’m a kind person. I’m caring. I love deeply, and I loved her with everything I had. We had this connection — laughs, support, real moments. We had our inside jokes. Our song. Our future plans. And now, it feels like it all just dissolved in a 5-minute call.

The next morning, I sent her a message telling her how much I love her. Told her I believed in us, that there’s still more to our story. That the future isn’t some far-off thing — it’s what we choose right now. She read it. Didn’t reply.

That silence hurt.

Sunday night I sent a light TikTok — something just meant to lift her up — and a message saying, “hope you’re doing okay.” She responded within 30 minutes, said she was doing alright, and asked how I was. I told her I was okay. Then I slipped and said, “I miss you.” I didn’t mean to drop that in, but it’s the truth.

She didn’t push me away. Didn’t say anything harsh. She’s not a cruel person — which makes this harder. Because it’s not hate. It’s not coldness. It’s just… distance. And it’s killing me.

She’s leaving on Friday for a month, so I sent one more message today. Said I’d like to see her before she goes — just to talk, no pressure. Told her I’d understand if she wasn’t up for it. I added “hope you’re doing okay” to the end, because honestly, I mean it. I haven’t heard back yet. It’s been a few hours and I’m trying not to spiral.

I just don’t get how someone who says they love you can let you go so easily. I’m still here, hoping. Not begging, not chasing — just holding space for her. Hoping she remembers what we had. Hoping maybe she misses me too.

I don’t want to lose her. But I also don’t want to lose myself trying to keep something alive that she’s already walked away f",2,2,2025-06-30 09:27:19,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo33k4/15months_and_shes_gone_but_still_loves_me/,,,I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay and I suggest you focus on yourself while she is gone. Don't forget to not suppress your feelings too. ||| I'm sorry that you're going through this.
My ex and I talk again,"It's weird
I sent him an email for closure and where I take accountability for what I did wrong in the relationship. 
I was really hoping to get over him after this message and go no contact. 
Somehow, what happened was the reverse. 
We seem to have reconnect somehow. 
He is open to have conversations, answer pretty fast as well. 
He made a bad joke earlier in the week, but I got over it. I can't control who he is in the inside. 
He pretended he got married to a girl he met where he works at and said stuff like he regrets what happened to us and he missed me and how we used to talk and listen to each other. 

I know he didn't changed. I don't expect us to be together again too.

But, it feels strange. We have chemistry, everything flows naturally. It happened the same thing when we first met in person. Yet, we are not compatible.

I know I'd deceive a lot of my friends if they knew I still talk to him, but intellectually, he is the only one I can have this much depth in conversations and he loves the same things as I do.
It makes me happy to have someone to share those things with. 

We are not talking to get back together and i don't think he even tries to reel me in, but this is where we are. 

He is my secret now. I can't tell anyone that I'm talking to him again after all we went through and what he put me through. 
We reconnected exactly 6 months later. In total, we were 2 months total no contact. 

I'm ashamed, but I can't help it. It's not because I still love him, it's because I didn't found anyone like him.

I guess I just needed to vent ",0,8,2025-06-30 13:13:03,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo76op/my_ex_and_i_talk_again/,,,"It would be the same for me if I started communicating with my ex again.  I guess the real question you need to ask yourself is what do you want from this ‘connection’ - friendship? Acquaintances? I just think knowing what you want and having boundaries is important in these cases because you can often end up repeating what already happened. It’s nice that you can connect again though - I wish it could be the same for many of us. ||| My wife left 5 months ago over a stupid fight ran to her family. No if she was to come home she would have to tell her family and that’s not going to happen. No matter what she wants fear and shame of what they say won’t allow her to come home. ||| It's a slippery slope. You can end up back together without meaning to (happened to me previously). You end up getting attached again and before you know it, the relationship is back on. I'd highly recommend having a think about what you want before proceeding. I could have done without the relationship resuming (the relationship was shite but he was my first love)."
I hate the dreams. Get out of my head,"I’m sitting here awake at 5am. I wish I treated her better. I wish she treated me better. It’s been a month and a half and I thought I was starting to do better. I keep trying to tell can’t be disappointed for feeling so sad, because it’s all part if the process.

I got abruptly broken up with. I miss him,"I don’t know what else to add. 
I miss him. It’s been two months. He said he loved me but doesn’t know if he wants to be with me still. He needs time to heal and process because he came out of an abusive relationship. 
But I miss him dearly ",3,9,2025-06-30 07:05:02,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo10fq/i_got_abruptly_broken_up_with_i_miss_him/,,,"I'm not gonna say ""if he really loved you he would've stayed"" because life isn't black and white. He can love you and be in pain and want to keep you away from him, maybe he lied, maybe there's something or someone else. No one knows, but now you have to make a choice;  Stay on him and most likely hurt yourself with the very small chance you would work out.  Or move on to someone new, someone who can love you and be with you now, care and love you like you deserve. The second opinion is much more safe and healthy. But it's ultimately your choice."
She downloaded Tinder,"Myself and my gf broke up on good terms two weeks ago. We share an apartment together and a few pets. Just today she managed to tell me she downloaded Tinder because she wanted to mention my friend who has a gf was on there.

Make sure you prioritise finding a way to figure out new living arrangements, and do your best to stay afloat until this all blows over. You got this 🙏 ||| Just for fun? So she’s not grieving or processing the relationship ending? She’s just ‘having a laugh?’  That would tell me all I need to know to walk away from her and let her fester in rebounds. ||| It’s for her attention disorder.

Download tinder and feed her the same bs ||| Don’t engage with her.  Tinder?    She is dirt off your shoulder. ||| I would leave if you could and I would try and take your pets with you. A lot of what’s been said is true in my opinion. I know it’s a hard choice and don’t be so hard on yourself with whatever you choose to do. ||| I downloaded Bumble two days after my boyfriend broke up with me because I was feeling deeply low and broken. The relationship had been mentally and physically abusive, and I wasn’t looking to hook up, I just needed a decent conversation, something to remind me that I was still worth something. Going on dating apps after a breakup is generally not for fun. She’s probably just hurting. It wasn’t the right choice, but sometimes people act out when they’re silently screaming for help. She might be dealing with emotional wounds or unresolved childhood trauma that she hasn’t come to terms with yet. I could be wrong, but I just wanted to give a different perspective. Either way, it’s probably best that you two go your separate ways, as she has a lot to learn about herself."
Can a dumper (or anyone) explain to me delayed grieving?,"I can't imagine how people only start grieving a relationship months after the breakup.

The distance was so hard (especially for me), and it was the main reason for our breakup. We really loved each other and we didn't want to break up but she decided to stay in her country for a few more years. I thought I couldn't handle the distance for more time so I pushed the idea of breaking up.  And at the beginning, the break up was okay for me. She was really bad, but me I was just starting an Erasmus abroad and so much things were happening in my life. I didn't really have the time to think about it. Then 3 months into the break up she sent me that long message to let me know all the things she didn't like during our relationship: my bad behaviors, things that hurt her and she didn't tell me, etc. She was glad the relationship was over  2 months after that message, the breakup hit. Now it's been 1.5 years that I'm without her and I still miss her every single day. When we broke up, we made stupid promises like ""*we are gonna find each other again*"". I realize now that I truly believed in those promises and that is why I didn't feel that bad at the beginning. She was the love of my life, of course we were gonna end up together. Then when she told me she was glad our relationship was over and that she didn't want a relationship with me again, it hit a first time. But a part of me still continued to believe we could find each other again.  2 weeks ago I learned she has a new boyfriend. It hit a second time. ||| I was okay for 2 months, now I feel like I’m dying and being ripped apart.

Well I once dated a psychopath and I'd just like some imput,"They're the one's who broke up with me being “my mental health was affecting them in damaging ways“— didn't once tell me that they were concerned about it and I had to talk with their mom so they'd give me a reason because before they just cut me off without saying shit! And funny thing was that they had anger issues- like to the point if somebody had a different opinion they'd wish death on that person and talk about how they'd kill them- not to also mention that they talked about wanting to kill my Dad by breaking his back... And they also “joked“ about wanting to spy on me, cut my private parts if I were to cheat- forced me to think about some sexual things involving them even though I clearly stated I wouldn't be comfortable doing that. And there was one time I was like “Sorry but... Could you not talk so hateful around me...? You could always talk about it with other people though!!“- and they basically snapped at me saying that they're not in the wrong and I just have to deal with their way of coping with anger. There was also another time I was wishing them a speedy recovery when it came to a physical injury and they snapped at me too for it because they were ""appalled“ by me wishing them to heal quickly because they considered that impossible. They also called my jokes dumb a lot and generally whenever I brought up an issue they either were like “Omggg poor me I'm now suffering “ or “Eh, whatever sorry you feel that way.“ while whenever they brought up an issue with me I'd have a mental breakdown and beg for ways to make it up to them. Oh- oh! They're also basically Joe Goldberg/JD from Heathers/Chae yul from Secret Alliance and ever since I was the one to cut contact the second time- they've been stalking me online a bit :(((-

A bit of help. I’m at such a low point.,"I know that there are often posts like this where people ask what certain things in a break up mean and we try find understanding in all of it. 

It’s 3 months post breakup. It wasn’t a relationship that I wanted to end even though it had its the emotional abuse I endured throughout was something I believed I needed to put up with as “Karmic justice” for people I’ve hurt along the way. And eventually what led to the break up was when my ex gf took photos and shared pages of my journal with her friends and family. The contents of the journal have spread and the narrative of our break up has changed many times where in the one retelling of the story my dad had passed away? 

There’s a lot of context that I have omitted because this post will become too long. But I am at such a low point. This break up hurts me everyday. I have been hospitalised for suicidal ideation. I have started exercising, I have started CBT therapy and new meds but day by day this pain gnaws at me and it won’t stop. I feel so attached to someone who has just so easily walked away. In the break up I respected her and distanced myself but all it’s done is led to me being blocked everywhere by her and her sister except for WhatsApp which confuses me. 

I know that each break up is different but the pain we experience is similar and peoples actions are more or less the same when processing these feelings. 

But I have lost so much of myself. I can’t trust journaling because of how it was weaponised against me. I feel like I am carrying the emotional weight of it all. While my ex is out partying and making it known. 

I have lost my way. I just need some guiding light to point me in the right direction .

The heart is slower than the brain,"I just checked my calendar and apparently it’s been 5 weeks since the break up. I broke NC throughout the first week to ask for his side of the explanation and to clear some misunderstandings, and about a week after that, I broke NC yet again by sending him a link to a firework event in his city, because I stumbled upon it on Instagram and he likes fireworks and remember him saying he wanted to watch one. That turned into a conversation, where he basically said that he was already feeling better and healing 2 weeks since the break up, while it has been a rollercoaster for me. I asked if I could be honest and he said it was my call and to bear the consequences. I said I missed him and how we could be very open and comfortable with each other, etc. He said he’s trying to detach from me, not rely on me and find other source of entertainment, not get more hurt, and I’m making it harder for him. I was asking if there was any underlying reasons as he ended things abruptly after sponsorship was brought up (we were 5 months LDR nevermets who were gonna meet up in the 8th month, I was gonna move to him from the west coast to the east coast after working on getting my own PR in the next 3y, and he was gonna let me move into his place in his province). He said no, and it was really just because he lost trust, lost love, and he thinks it’s not worth it anymore to put effort into this relationship because we’d just keep hurting each other so it’s better to end things now than later when we were more committed. 

Towards the end of the conversation, he said that the longer I latch on, the worse it gets, and that I’m really close to reaching his limit to block me. I said okay, I’m sorry, I’ll let you go, and I won’t text / reach out ever again.

He previously said that blocking hurts him more and feels toxic, so he prefers not to block.

So I’m keeping my last words to him, that’s all I can do now.. I just checked and it’s been 19 days since that last conversation and actual NC.

But anyway… I’m writing this because I don’t wanna keep bringing my friends’ or my sister’s mood down… some of my friends are also going through a hard time and I just want my sister to enjoy her trip to the fullest, so it’s kind of like journaling and I don’t really have to say sorry here since people are free to read something if they want to and skip if they want to..

So… A few days ago.. was my graduation day.. I cried during a speech that asked us to look at the people who have been here for us and made it possible for us to get this far, because he wasn’t there, he’ll never be there even in the happy, easy, proud, and big moments. I was grateful to have my family attend my convocation, but it was a challenge for me to pretend as if everything was okay, and to smile in the pictures.

Now.. I’ve been in a tour to the Rocky Mountains for 2 days now with my family since they’re staying with me for about 2 weeks to make the trip worth it and today we had a cruise in the Maligne Lake in Jasper, Alberta. It was magnificent. Serene, calming, beautiful. But there were times when I thought that I wanted to share this with him.. but I can’t anymore.. I wanted to make a joke about the captain’s parking skills because we played Sea of Thieves together.. but I can’t anymore. I’m not even the type to post on Instagram, I just use it to view public accounts’ posts. I really just thought that the view was too good not to share with him. But.. he doesn’t wanna hear from me anymore, he doesn’t care anymore..

These past few weeks.. I’ve had less jokes come into my mind that I would’ve otherwise told him to make him laugh. I threw away the flowers from the bouquet he sent me that I dried, so it’d have lasted for years instead of weeks, ‘cause looking at them everyday reminded me of what I lost, my regrets, and what happened. And I’ve let myself cry whenever the tears come, instead of holding them in except when I’m in front of family. I’ve reflected a whole lot, and know that I have a lot to work on (and have been working on) like thinking more positively, believing in myself more, not saying or thinking bad stuffs about myself especially if I don’t even mean it or don’t truly think that way, being more patient & taking things slow, work on my communication skills, not dwelling / replaying conversations, passive aggresiveness, not overthinking, thinking before talking, worrying too much, thinking too far ahead and a whole lot more. Have been learning about attachment styles and relationship psychology as well to try and understand better about why and how he just lost love so fast like that. I thought the relationship was good and mostly secure most of the time, we were on good terms, and only had 2-3 serious talk, that was it. Never fought or been in a huge argument before.

My brain has accepted that it’s over, that he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore, that there’s no going back, he’s never coming back. And I wasn’t even planning to take pics or vids to share with him, but when I was at the place… it just came to mind.

It was so abrupt… it all happened so fast..
I know I’ll get through this but damn.

I am in that process or I am going to be soon. Why did you break off the relationship, if I may ask? Did you agree from the beginning to no contact?

Do you think it was a good choice for you to break no contact to clear up doubts or do you regret it now?"
Not sure i'll ever be over her,"I dont find myself attractive by any means. 
I searched a girl for a long time, dating apps, instagram DMs, very little to none cold approaches though.
Nothing except a date here and there with a girl I didn't rven want for a second date (and she didn't want as well)

Then I finally met her, just sent a casual instagram DM at midnight and she answered, we talked and talked long story short 9 months together.

She broke up with me 6 weeks ago, I had my ego up, I didn't care to lose her, I told myself from the get go that I don't want her because of private stuff I found I don't like. She looked good though, like, my body type. 

But i knew body type is important by knowledge is important for me too (she didn't have much)

Bow that she's gone I feel like that scene ""oh shit here we go again""... searching for another girl, rejecting bc of body type, distance, personality, maybe she ever rejects me before... Endless cycle of dates.

I feel like I blew up my only chance of relationship with an honest girl that would never leave me for someone else. That I hurt her verbally, my first ever person to be intimate with me.. for no valid reason, just because I am such a fool and needed treatment way before that. Too late but never too late to start therapy which I already started.

I just want to die seriously I am no place in this world anymore, every hobby I do I feel like I'm doing it to forget and not to enjoy it.

Being objectively ugly is such a curse, I should've held right onto her not causing any single little thing that could cause her to leave me, so let alone lashing out.

And I know that with this mentality no girl would want me, I don't show it to the outside, I just feel it inside and vent here online. But damn that burns me every day and I am not over her.

There are different phases to a relationship and it always starts with the honeymoon phase. Ofcourse I dont know how well you guys bonded or how much of each other did you really get to know.

Ghosted by girlfriend,"Ghosted by girlfriend (1.5 year relationship)

Hey everyone,

I've been feeling like I need to talk about this, but have been unsure where to post it. Hope this place is okay. (also posted in r/ghosting)

So I (20M) had been in a long distance relationship for around a year and a half with my girlfriend (19F). Things were going really well, had a few ups and downs as with all relationships, but overall things were great and we had plans to meet (which I had been saving for for a while, had just gotten enough to visit her). However around 3 months ago, she got super busy with exams and other activities. So we didnt talk at all for like a couple weeks, which sucked, but it was fine I guess. However, eventually that 2 weeks turned into 2 months. 
After her exams she just didnt reach out still? She stayed gone, didnt say a single word. We still had eachother added on various platforms, so I could see her online activity. She would play games with complete strangers, all while still ignoring me. I figured she was just going through some stuff, so I gave her some space, only messaging every 5-7 days. It was clear in many of my messages that I was very upset, especially given we have had conversations in the past about how this kind of behaviour really hurts me.
She knew how I felt, she knew the pain I was going through, and yet she still continued to ignore me. 
Eventually, about a month ago, I just had enough and sent a lengthy message laying out my emotions, while still reinforcing that I still loved her very much. Finally she responded just a few hours later, saying she was sorry and we agreed to find a time to voice call about everything.
So we did that, and she explained how she had been having doubts about the relationship and didnt know how to bring it up, and at the end of the call she broke up with me.
I of course was very hurt, but I forgave her initially.
But after taking a couple weeks to think about it all, I realised that what she had done was honestly bordering on emotional abuse, or at the very least its extremely cruel. I decided I couldn't forgive her, and although we initially agreed to stay friends, I changed my mind on that. How could someone put anyone through that kind of pain, let alone their partner? 
I sent a new message to her, telling her we could no longer be friends, and laid out my feelings about what she had done more clearly and honestly than I had previously. I told her in this that I believed it was borderline emotional abuse. Because even if she didnt intentionally hurt me (so she says anyway), she 100% knew how I was feeling, and still chose to keep ignoring me. At this, she got extremely angry, claiming I was being insensitive and nasty because she had been in an emotionally abusive relationship before. 
Even if its quite harsh wording to use, I do believe its completely valid. 

All of this is to say, ghosting is completely disgusting. Fuck anyone who ghosts their partner or friends. During that time I was being ghosted, it destroyed my self worth, my mental health, and I felt extreme anxiety and depression 24/7. I was the best boyfriend that I could be, even if not perfect, I did not deserve that. 
I'm not sure everyone will agree, but in my opinion, ghosting is emotionally abusive. Please, no one ever do it. 

Thanks for reading my ramblings 🫠",2,1,2025-06-30 08:24:07,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo263m/ghosted_by_girlfriend/,,,"Bro, when she hit me with ghosting, I fought back and got what I wanted.

What does it mean when my ex replies like this on her birthday?,"
Hey guys, I posted here before about my breakup, but I’ll quickly summarize so you have context. My ex and I were together for 3 years in a long-distance relationship (about 400km apart). The breakup wasn’t because of distance or a third person — we ended things on relatively good terms, though the last year had more arguments, sometimes over small things. There were even a few failed attempts at breaking up before, but around Christmas, when she visited me, she told me she wanted to end it for real.

After the breakup (early January), we still talked a fair bit during the first month. Then we had a period of no contact, but about a month after that, she texted me saying she missed me and that she’d probably message again — but it’s now been 3 months since that, and I hadn’t heard anything.

Yesterday was her birthday. I decided to send her a simple “Happy birthday” out of respect. She saw the message 7 minutes after I sent it, but didn’t reply until about 2 hours later — and all she said was “Thanks.”

What do you think this means? Was it just politeness? Does it show she wants distance? I can’t stop overthinking it.

There's nothing behind it. ||| You’re overthinking… why?

If you are attempting a come back tell her you thinking fond thought  of her on her birthday. See what happens. It might blow up or not. Returning to exes is difficult. Be careful. ||| It does not mean anything. You sent her a short text, she replied with a short text. And that’s it. What did you expect when you sent her your message? Surely you could not expect something very different from what you got."
Got an email from TikTok telling me my ex viewed my profile,"As any sensible, healing guy would do, I looked at their page before blocking them on there too. They are literally unrecognizable - posting thirst traps with nasty captions and hashtags. I saw one of their posts that said something like ""using a love song even though I'm single asf 💔"" as if they aren't the one who ended a 2.5 year relationship.

Luckily, I have great friends who kept me grounded today. Whatever all that is is their healing process and they're figuring themself out. It's just super icky to see them openly flirt, boast about being single, and based on some context clues they're totally talking to someone.

But hey, all I can do is control myself and protect my peace. But goodness, golly me, that notification that they viewed my profile was a jumpscare.

The worst part of my breakup wasn’t losing them. It was losing myself in the process,"I stayed too long. I made excuses. I tried to fix it. And when it ended, I was left with a version of myself I barely recognized. The worst part wasn’t the silence — it was the way I forgot my own worth.

That pain pushed me to start healing for real. I ended up creating something called The Real Love Manual based on all the lessons I had to learn the hard way. If you’re still in that messy middle space between letting go and moving on, this might speak to you.

It helped me stop romanticizing pain and start choosing peace. That’s where the healing actually begins.

Gf doesn’t want me to talk to other girls at all.,"I 28M have been with my girlfriend 30F for three years. She is a great partner and i am thinking about marrying her, although im not fully sure yet due to some disagreements we have. This is one of them. Where i live a disaster has happened that took multiple lives, a few months ago. A few days later, someone who i talked to online as a friend texted me to make sure i was okay. She texted me and others who she knew from my area. It was a total of six texts sent. Just her checking to see of I’m ok then i said yea and thanked her for checking on me, then she says you’re welcome and that’s it. No more extra texting after that. Fast forward a few days later and my gf happened to look at my phone and saw that this girl had texted me and she had a problem with it. I explained to her that this is her first time in three years contacting me, that she’s married, is very devoted to her religion (is a Jehovah’s witness), used to go out with my brother, and I’m not the type of person to go with someone my brother went with. That’s just awkward to me, yet she still had a problem with it. She says i shouldn’t text girls at all even if i am responding to them checking on me. I believe that to be true only depending on who they are. Of course if a girl that i used to date texts me to see if im ok, i shouldn’t respond, but someone who clearly isn’t interested in me and never was? I don’t see the harm in responding. Whenever i say that its not a big of a deal that i responded to the persons message, my girlfriend takes it as me saying that its ok for me to text other girls. She believes all this is normal for relationships. What do you guys think?

Could my(F 31) ex(M 30) be trying to intentionally hurt me after the breakup or is he revealing his true colors?,"My fiancé broke up with me during a fight, then he drove me home.  The fight was over something so small but escalated after he broke up with me. We didn't talk the entire way home but when we got to my house he was talking in a nice calm voice, like nothing happened. He said, ""Aww, who are those two kitties?"" in a cute voice at two of my cats in the window.

 He immediately unfollowed me on insta, which broke my heart because I thought he was just being hot headed at the time of breakup. So I blocked him on insta and Facebook (we were still friends on there for some reason).  I blocked his number and deleted it as well because I was in a lot of emotional pain and didn't want to even think about him or see his name. 

A few days of crying non stop and I remembered we still had our couples account that we never used. I went on and saw that he added 9 OF girls. Posts where they're in lingerie in sexual poses and bouncing their assets.  

When we first met, he only had a few of these but he got rid of them immediately.  I had told him, this kind of behavior was a no for me and he could date someone else who was okay with him dehumanizing women. 

The entirety of our relationship he said he wanted to be a better man for me and loved and respected me. Even after a while, his feed stopped showing that stuff and I believed and trusted him completely. 

I also saw he and his ex wife started following each other. 

When we got together, they weren't following or talking to each other but he had mentioned that they used to sleep with each other when he was single. He had said that she had brought up them getting back together (at that time) but he didn't want to because she was very immature and they had completely different values, and wants for life (housing, politics, kids, etc).

I'm more heartbroken now and I can't understand how he could go from telling me that he loved me with all his heart, and saying he knows he could never live without me (I had a health scare a month ago) to dumping me like I'm nothing and becoming a complete pig in just a matter of days. I don't see how all his love and respect could just disappear and he move onto another woman immediately. I see it as his love and respect was all a complete lie or he's trying to hurt me. Love and respect don't leave after a few days.

  
 I definitely don't want to get back, knowing what he's doing, but I want to understand how men can do this after supposedly loving and respecting them",2,1,2025-06-30 07:31:32,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo1el9/could_myf_31_exm_30_be_trying_to_intentionally/,,,Wsp I’m here

I Feel Lost,"I don’t usually post anything on Reddit. I’m more of a reading type of person, but I really feel lost right now and have no one else to ask. 

My stomach drops thinking about her moving on to someone new, and experiencing different things with somebody else. 

I got broken up by my first girlfriend of 2 years. It was my fault. I had so many issues that she was willing to wait for me to be better, but I ran out of time and she got tired. It broke my heart but I believe I did deserve it. It’s been two months since, and the pain I felt that day hasn’t left yet. We didn’t block each other, it ended on relatively good and civil terms, but we are no contact.

I’ve been working hard to become a better person, of course for myself but also for her. Everyday I wish for her to come back, for her to see that I have gotten better and will continue to, but it seems like she moved on. She seems happy without me, like nothing has happened. I admit, I still stalk her account and check everything (literally) that I can, because it’s like the only “connection” I have with her left. I am happy for her, I rather her be happy without me than sad with me, but I’m left with all of the pain. My stomach drops thinking about her moving on, completely stop loving me, loving someone new, and experiencing different things with somebody else. 

I still have some friends and family which I am very grateful for, but I can’t really talk to too many of them about my situation. I do many things with others to be happy and enjoy my life still with them, but it feels like everything I do is temporary happiness, until I’m reminded of what happened and how she is gone. 

Now I don’t know what to do. I have loved her for more than 6 years (4 years of chasing and 2 years being together), and lost the chance of her being the one I was gonna marry (we both wanted each other to be forever). I still want to chase her, I really want to break no contact but I fear that it might be the wrong decision (maybe push her farther away), at least for now. Even if I do, it feels as she wouldn’t care to read what I have to say anymore. I’m not ready to move on yet or give up and I still want to try, but it seems so difficult, especially because the chances of her coming back seem so slim. What do I do?",1,2,2025-06-30 10:56:54,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo4in2/i_feel_lost/,,,"Hey there! Sorry to hear this happened. I know it hurts badly. But trust me, this pain is fuel to change the rest of your life if you utilize it in the right way. And I’m not talking about going to the gym and getting angry. You rarely get such opportunities for inner work as a breakup. ||| I highly suggest stop stalking her account and move on. Seriously stop stalking her  because it's been affecting you a lot. Focus on yourself entirely not her. I don't think you're able to move on because you are still sulking over her. Put down your phone and take a walk from outside. Life is still beautiful even when you're alone and single. There's so many things that you can enjoy. If you keep thinking about her then I suggest going to a gym will disturb your mind. Understand yourself that you have been hurting yourself over her and prioritize yourself instead of her. She is actively moving on and you should too."
I’m grieving hard over the person I thought I fell in love with (3 years together),"This was my first ever relationship starting at age 26 and I just turned 29. 
She was my first love and I thought she loved me back. I wanted to marry her and grow together. She broke up with me on 06/28 because she felt not only was she “holding me back” in achieving my goals but also because of recent familial events cumulating in her feeling like she hasn’t been prioritizing her own mental health and focusing more on myself and others and wanting to better herself by losing weight (we met when she was 140lbs and recently up to 230lbs)

The whole situation felt like a total cop out and in my own opinion she just wanted an easy way out in the relationship because she got bored of me, lost attraction, and was more interested in somebody else or even seeing them for god knows how long behind my back. It always felt like I was walking on eggshells for the past couple of months to a year, when she also mentioned having been contemplating breaking up, and she kept snapping at me almost like she was resenting me and blamed me for it. She told me over and over that she was telling the truth and she wanted to focus on herself and couldn’t do that in a relationship. I’m not fucking stupid. 

That was absolutely a lie and I swear it was to save face and I’m sure on some level it was to ease the pain of telling me that she was actually interested in someone else but I would’ve rather her have told me that she no longer wanted to be with me than lie to my face.

In hindsight there were little red flags sprinkled here and there that I should’ve called her out on but I didn’t because I never thought she would hurt me that way. Honestly, looking back I think she used me the whole time and none of it was real on her end; but to me it was real.

When I met her, this little child in me sparked right up and now she absolutely killed him and any last bit of love or feelings I ever felt. The entire text messages sounded like she was a cold and calculating therapist trying to ease me through the process of a breakup instead of the woman I thought I knew and loved. To say I’m heartbroken is an understatement and I don’t think she’ll ever tell me the truth that what she really wanted was out and latch onto someone else. I don’t think she ever really loved me at all from the beginning.

We started relationship counseling and everything was going great, even she said so. Then a few days ago I mentioned, out of curiosity, if I had never mentioned relationship counseling, would she have. And she said “… I don’t know” and then mentioned wanting to break up. She probably used that as an opportune time to break it off. The whole day up to that point we were enjoying each others company. 

She never cared or loved me at all and sometimes I wish I had never met her. I gave her everything I had in my heart and soul and she fucking killed the little kid in me. I know for a fact that she’s probably in bed not giving two single shits about any of this and beyond happy that I’m finally out of her life. I gave her everything I had and it was never going to be enough.",0,1,2025-06-30 10:53:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo4gfe/im_grieving_hard_over_the_person_i_thought_i_fell/,,,"Hey!

I Knew…But I Didn’t Want to Believe It,"A week after being broken up with by my girlfriend of four years, I (23 M) walked around campus in a daze until I came across a colleague of mine (23 F). I told her I had just gotten broken up with and she said she was going through something similar. I said “let’s go cry at the beach together” and went spent the rest of the day just going around LA together. For next the six months we spent every moment together: on campus, after classes, going to the malls, going on trips, vlogging everything, making a scrapbook for the future, and I even helped her move into a new apartment with the promise to move in when my lease was over. We started dating after 2 months of talking and we were happy until we started saying I love you.

The relationship got too real for her and after four months of dating, she said she needed a week to herself because she is feeling confused about the relationship. I felt the pull and chased to not let go of what we were building. I knew she was going to break up with me and was preparing to do so by getting space. She said she wasn’t ready for the relationship and couldn’t put in the same effort I could, so we broke up a few days ago.

There isn't any other option than going through this, feel it It's a part of healing"
My EX used psychological warfare against me,"This is not your typical breakup story, she left me paralyzed in every aspect of my life and made sure to hurt and damage me as much as possible - all while she's hoping me to do well on the surface. 

we were together for 3 years, 3 years of love, harmony, care, she used to call me, she used to tell me how much she loves me, spend the rest of her life with me, that our love was divine, that our love was special, that our love was forever, eternal, that our souls are intertwined 

she left me knowing that I would be suffering while pretending like nothing happened, laughed at me when I asked for her help multiple times, she ghosted me after telling me "" I wish I can't sleep so I can spend more time with you"" I was going insane for a whole month, calling, texting, even emailing her, and all I got was a dry response ( I'm working on myself and evolving I need space and clarity) = she was processing the breakup. no courage to tell me that she was breaking up with me (Avoidant Pro Max) we were so close, texting every hour and calling for 2 hours a day minimum and calling in the morning and at night before sleep, I wrote her hundreds of poems, hundreds of love letters. I was her Father\\Mother\\Best-Friend\\lover\\Husband.  some of you might not grasp this but that's how deep was our relationship. we promised to be together forever, we made so many promises and she broke every single one of them, with no regards, no respect, nothing.   
  
 I lost my sanity after she ghosted me, I couldn't process anything. I couldn't eat, sleep, I lost weight and I was fainting. everything hit me like a nuke vaporizing me to atoms, The pain I felt can't be described with words, it's the worst thing a human can feel, worse than death. I was dying everyday not knowing what's happening to me, physical pain, physical heartburn, physical trauma I was experiencing every pain possible, I was shivering nonstop for weeks my body was cold. I was begging her to answer my calls, my texts, I was pleading for help nonstop. but this meant nothing to her, she turned ice cold like I was nothing to her absolutely nothing.   
  
at the end of the month of her ignoring me, she started texting me back with delayed dry responses, and the first thing she tells me, she's installing a dating app and wanna date new people. I begged her to stop, I said let's workout whatever the problems is like adults, I will apologize and do everything you want. but it was like talking to a wall, she was doing anything she wanted and whatever was convenient to her. and this even not worst thing yet. I tried to calm myself down with any means possible and thought maybe I'm truly a bad person and she deserves someone better than me. 

  
maybe someone will make her happier than I did maybe maybe maybe. but 3 days later she tells me that she matched with someone and they're going on a date. this hurt me like hell I was burning from the inside and I still wished her to be happy and she said the ""same"" ahahahahhaha what a pathological liar. now here's the bombshell that struck me and shattered me to my core, the guy she matched with ( directly supports the people who were responsible for the murder of my father and uncle) she bragged to me about how Good it was to make out with him for a straight hour, how good it was to have sex with him.  that he was bigger than me, she said it was better than the 3 years of love she had with me.

she deliberately made sure that I knew who she was sleeping with, and how much it would hurt me, for 3 years I warned her and told her how much pain these people have caused me, they ruined my life. 

  
 and her reason for all of this ? is that I asked her about her past experiences and questioned her about them. that's why she broke up with me, that's why she done this to me. she denied and rewrote our history, lied, and said leaving me was growth and evolving. she said I was holding her back and controlling her.

I don't know how to deal with this, I don't even know which pain I'm feeling anymore, nothing is stopping, I lost half of my weight, my hair is falling, I'm barely eating anything to function. I'm feeling unfathomable heartburn, betrayal, physical pain even feel worse now, I'm in total despair. I lost my sanity. I can't even think coherently. And no therapy won't work on me I've tired before don't even think of suggesting this. it's been 4 months since she left me and everything have gotten worse since then.

I 20M unexpectedly met the girl of my dreams 20F soon after ending a 3 year relationship and I feel AWFUL!!,"
I guess I’ll start from the beginning of the end. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of nearly three years for a number of reasons. I won’t get into the details, but it wasn’t a messy breakup—we agreed to stay friends. I still love and care about her deeply, but it was just time for us to go our separate ways and grow, like so many others eventually do.
After the breakup, my plan was to focus on improving myself. I told her this, and reassured her that there was no one else—I genuinely meant it at the time. I had no intention of getting involved with anyone new for a while. But, of course, life had other plans. About a week after the breakup, I got a text from an old acquaintance (not really a close friend) asking if I wanted to watch the sunset and catch up. She had no idea I’d just broken up with my girlfriend—I hadn’t told anyone.
At first, I didn’t want to go. Even though it seemed harmless, I wasn’t ready to hang out with another girl. But then I thought, if I’m trying to grow and do things differently, maybe I should step out of my comfort zone. So I decided to go. Within the first ten minutes of hanging out, something just clicked between us. The connection was insane—we were so similar, and it felt refreshing to talk to someone on the same wavelength.
After that first hangout, I just thought I’d made a new, really close friend. We kept in touch, hung out a few more times, and quickly became close. It felt good to enjoy each other’s company. Then, one night, we were hanging out and drinking, and she didn’t want to drive home. I told her she could stay at my place—she’d take the guest room, I’d sleep in my bed. We put on a movie, and sure enough, we started making out. But it didn’t last long—I just couldn’t go through with it. It felt wrong. After being with the same person for three years, it was hard to be with someone else so soon. My body almost rejected the idea.
I felt terrible, thinking I might lose her as a friend, but she was understanding and didn’t want to lose me either. We agreed to pretend that night never happened and kept hanging out. But we kept getting closer. Within a week, we were sleeping over at each other’s places, cuddling, and doing cute things together. Still, we weren’t having sex—I just wasn’t ready.
Eventually, we both admitted we had feelings for each other. But we also agreed that dating wasn’t an option, since I’d just gotten out of a long relationship and we both have to go back to different colleges soon. So we’re in this in-between space: not just friends, but not dating, and not sleeping together. We just love each other’s company and care about each other a lot. She honestly feels like the girl of my dreams—it’s just not the right time.
Now, I feel awful. How can I tell my ex that I’m not seeing anyone and focusing on myself, then start hanging out with someone new just a week later? I know I’m allowed to feel how I feel, but it still aches. I care about my ex and want the best for her. I don’t want her to get hurt if she finds out I’ve been spending time with someone else so soon.
I’m supposed to pick my ex up from the airport in a couple of days, just to give her a ride home—because we’re still friends, and our breakup wasn’t messy. But the new girl doesn’t know about this, and I’m not sure if I should tell my ex about what’s going on with the new girl, or just keep it to myself. If my ex finds out, it’ll break her heart. On the other hand, I don’t want to ruin things with the new girl by picking up my ex, because I know how that might look.
I know I’m a good guy at heart, but I feel like I’ve dug myself into a hole I can’t get out of. I don’t want to hurt either of them. I don’t want my ex to think this new girl was the reason we broke up—because she wasn’t. And I don’t want the new girl to think I’m getting back with my ex—because I’m not. I care about them both. I just need some advice.",1,11,2025-06-30 09:20:56,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo309d/i_20m_unexpectedly_met_the_girl_of_my_dreams_20f/,,,"Disgusting. ||| If you care about your ex at all, if you have basic human respect for the last 3 years you spent together and each other’s respective futures, then you need to be upfront about it.

You just have to choose ||| Tbh your ex doesn’t need your assurance anymore it’s done and gone but take a break from dating it would be good for you ||| I don't think that you have an obligation to divulge your dating status to your ex-girlfriend. (And don't kid yourself -- you *are* dating this new girl.)  However, this ""problem"" will basically take care of itself once you go back to college. You can keep in touch with both the new girl and your ex, and you can let your ex know that you plan date other people and that she should do the same. ||| This happens all the time, it’s not special. When people exit long term relationships, they meet someone new, and immediately think it’s fireworks and true love.   Here’s why it happens: you knew your ex really well. You knew everything including flaws and things you two would argue about. Once a relationship goes on for a few years, it always gets a bit boring. It’s just human nature. It happens with everything. That pair of shoes you were waiting months to buy, becomes plain and boring after you’ve had them a while.   The new girl triggered the dopamine that you haven’t felt since the beginning of your relationship with your ex. Dopamine is the addictive hormone that gets released in honeymoon stage. She’s not your dream girl (most likely), she’s just new and shiny right now.   Not to mention, you’re both going off in different directions very soon. I don’t think you owe your ex anything, but it does come off sleazy to get into something a week after you told her you’d be healing. I think you’ll hurt the new girl. ||| It's a natural rebound response. The new girl is replacing the dopamine hits your ex used to give you. Eventually they'll stop. You need a few months to mourn the end of your relationship, and you're totally leading the new girl on. Take a break from dating until you go back to school and get settled in. In 6 months maybe contact the new girl and see if feelings still remain. ||| She will be your karma i guess ||| You and the new girl are not dating so you owe her nothing, and dont tell your ex, it gonna do nothing but hurt her, if she later finds out your with someone its better if she doesnt know yalls timeline"
"I broke no contact, again.","I got way too emotional today, cried at a park, smoked, drank, and texted her, I couldn't resist the urge, heck I'd be surprised if she even sees my message, but yeah, I've done it, what a shame.",48,22,2025-06-29 12:16:22,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnda7d/i_broke_no_contact_again/,,,"That's the challenge my friend.  That's the challenge, to fight the urge of losing yourself in that past. We miss it because it felt like heaven when she was with us. But she's not now. And yeah life is going to Suck for a while.  But we have to find ourselves back now. You were good before she came in your life, and You're going to be fine without her too. Even better perhaps, because you'll learn from this experience. Not today, not tomorrow, but soon.   Stay strong buddy. Life has always been a solo mode game. Find yourself. ||| Don't beat yourself up. No contact is not a religion. You're healing and you're still feeling what you're feeling. Alcohol, for example, doesn't change who you are, but it lets your inhibitions down. So while you might normally have the strength to resist, it will make you just a bit weaker. So what? You texted. You feel. You miss. So do we all. That's what makes us human. That's what makes us emotionally healthy humans. The ability to shut down your emotions is neither normal nor healthy. That's exactly the problem in many of these relationships.  So you texted her. Fine. Think about it. Something will happen, or it won't. You can't go back. Sober up, and you realize it probably wasn't worth it. But many of us have been there. Moment of humanity, not a moment of weakness. ||| What are you trying to achieve? Im just on the other side, and these texts puzzle me all the time. Its never effective. ||| I hear you brother. It’s all part of the process, trust me you’ll get tired of it eventually it’s all part of the process but just know the more you do the more she’s getting distant from you. So anytime you feel like doing it again just know you’re getting further from the goal. It’s okay though, one day all of these will mean nothing to you ||| not shame   just a relapse   you’re detoxing from something that felt like home  block again   delete the thread   no rereading, no rethinking, no self-beating  this isn’t failure   it’s round one of getting serious ||| Hey, the pain and withdrawl you are going through is understandble. But to be honest, breaking NC isn't good. I know how painful it is to see them not giving a damn about you but this is what it is. Cry and grieve as much as possible. Let the emotions flow. ||| Me too bro. I called her 3 times consecutively on Friday night after a long month of no contact! No answer… Gut wrenching!!! ||| I would suggest that you try to resist the urge to contact her and try to be the emotional stable secure person that she was drawn to in the first place. If you’re mature, accepting and classy about a breakup, you’d be surprised how that can play out later when all the dust settles and people have a chance to reflect.  Going down in a blaze of glory, with emotional please and wild accusations in going to leave an absolutely horrible lasting impression.  Play out in your head “What good will come from this” before u hit send. ||| I often go and change my settings in WhatsApp so that I can see when she was last online. I feel the urge often too. But it is was too much what I would say. I would sound desperate, maybe resentful from her pov and a man with no action but simply desperate. So, I decide to write these messages in my notices just to get them out. I really needed a better closure. ||| Cut out the substances..they are not your friend right now."
"Post-breakup living situation as ""good friends"" is confusing me","I and my now-ex GF had been together for 7 years and have been living together for 5 years. She broke up with me a few weeks ago saying her emotional connection with me had faded away in the last few years. She said she still likes me as a person and also had a bunch of happy moments, but she didn't think we were meant as lifelong partners.

We talked a lot since then and opened up about each other much more than we did in the last 7 years, which we both appreciate.

In a nutshell I have my set of problems that turned me into a stressed-out egoist, and she has her set of problems that made her a conflict-avoiding person who pretends like everything is fine until it’s too late to repair the relationship.

I’ve been an emotional wreck, but I’m doing what I can - changing my habit, taking a therapy for the first time in my life, seeking medical attention to my mental health. I knew I probably had issues for a long time (ADHD, depression, burnout) which had been affecting not only our relationship but also pretty much every aspect of my life, but I had never really opened up about them or took any actions to address them because I was afraid and also one of the big issues I have is procrastination.

Anyway, we’re still living together. In the morning she comes to my bedroom to say good morning. When she comes home in the evening (I work from home), I welcome her home. We then cook dinner and eat together. Just like how we lived for the last 5 years, except there’s now a bit of physical distance.

We share a hobby (sport) which we are both passionate about, and even after I’ve started living alone, we’ll still see each other on a weekly basis.

Just this weekend we went to an event related to the hobby that we had planned to go. Shared hobby also means we have a lot of mutual friends, and some of them are our closest friends as well. But she says she hasn’t told anyone about our break-up (except for a couple of her closest friends outside the community). So people naturally assumed we were still a couple. I was trying to spend as much time as possible separately, but she was still sticking around as if she didn’t want others to find out we broke up.

All this is really confusing me.

On the surface we still look like a couple, and even at home we’re still more than just roommates. I know she didn’t make the decision to break up lightly or hastily. Perhaps she’s just being considerate while I’m still grieving. But it’s making it really difficult for me to let go of the false hope we can still get back together.",1,0,2025-06-30 09:05:45,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo2s5u/postbreakup_living_situation_as_good_friends_is/,,7 year(s),
"Please, help me, I can't handle the pain","After months of taking care of him and being present for him, trying to leave several times after he tells me his feelings are blocked and can't develop love feelings for me (situationship), but always coming back to me, now that he's finally better he won't come back to me this time. 

We took bigger distance 2 weeks ago. 

And I'm left so broken. Im so empty. How could I betray myself and my values like this? How could I give so much to a man that never wanted to enter a relationship with me? 

But you know what's the worst part? We have the same hobby and run into each other a lot. Tonight, I saw him at a place we go to to practice. He was holding a girl in his arms, like a hug you do to someone you have a lot of affection for. Just to my face. He went to the other side of the room after that, maybe realizing this was inappropriate. 

Now he's living his life and feeling better after ""all the things he understood since he met me"", and I'm here, left completely broken with a self confidence that has never been so low. We had everything : physical attraction, chemistry, connection, the same life plans. But he never wanted to commit. I tried to leave several times and he dares to say ""but I have been clear with you, I don't have love feelings for you"" last time we met upon his request to have a good time. 

I think what hurts the most is feeling I was replaced so quickly. 

Please, how do you overcome the pain of seeing someone you love with someone else, just to your face and every week? How do you even cope with that when you're drained, heartbroken and feel like a piece of shit that is unlovable ? I lost all my light and joy.

Breaking toxic patterns before they break me [M 28] and her [F 28],"What's so wrong with me? Why do I behave like this?

Let me start by saying that I \[M, 28\] have been in therapy for 9 months now, and I plan to continue. My therapist is good, and she's helping me unlock things little by little, but there's still a long way to go.

I've been with my girlfriend \[F, 28\] for 7 years. Basically, she’s convinced she wants kids, and I very likely don’t. We made a compromise: if after a year I still don’t want them, we’ll break up. For me, even making a compromise on something this big doesn't feel right. Knowing that I’ll probably never develop the desire to have a child, it feels stupid to waste her time. Every day I think I’ll talk to her about it, but then I don’t.

I’m not very sexually attracted to her. That’s always been an issue, and lately it’s gotten worse. I have sex with her just to please her. It’s horrible to say, but that’s the truth. I feel uncomfortable while doing it.

Recently, I had a shitty situation at work. I went through a long hiring process for an important job, managed to get hired, and in two months I’ll have to move to a new city—so on top of everything else, our relationship is about to change.

My therapist says I struggle to talk because I come from a family where problems were never addressed, and any time I tried to express anger or disagreement as a kid, I was shut down. My parents recently separated after 30 years of marriage. Their marriage had clearly been failing for a long time, and they put off the decision forever—maybe out of fear of hurting the kids, maybe out of fear of hurting each other. It feels like I’m repeating the same pattern, ending up hurting both myself and the person I'm with.

Of course, our relationship has had good moments too, but right now I’m focused on the problems. Which are massive. And I tried to keep it short. If I read about someone else in a situation like this, I’d think, “What the f\*\*\*?”—yet here I am.

How do you break out of a vicious cycle like this?",1,0,2025-06-30 08:41:46,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo2f9z/breaking_toxic_patterns_before_they_break_me_m_28/,,9 month(s),

Severely attached to a ghoster.,"TL;DR im severely attached to a ghoster since 7 years.

I am a female 36 age i have been dealing with a man 47 age who i am in a long distance relationship with and severely attached to, since 7 years, in the span of 7 years he has constantly ghosted me for different reasons for example: sickness, charge and electricity issues, family and friend issues and more. I am constantly in pain and fear because of this. He has done this so many times that whenever he's not doing it or everything is fine, it feels like he's gonna do it any moment or he is talking to me forcefully. Im in a constant state of worry because of this. 

He has kept me so uncertain that i get so anxious whenever he doesn't come online, i feel like something happened to him, i keep ruminating about his death until and unless he comes online, and when he does i get relieved, but that relief is just for a short period of time as i then worry about when he's going to ghost me again. I have spoken to him about it and he assured me that it's not gonna happen again, and it didnt till now, but i cant seem to relax or stop worrying even for a moment. Whenever he's talking to me, i feel like he's doing it all forcefully and then i feel a sense of worthlessness and insult. Im in this cycle since 7 years now, I've completely drained, lost weight, my mental health got worse, anxiety increased and i can't seem to stop. It feels like im in a hole and i will never get out. Its too painful. I even support him financially but i dont see any efforts, happiness, gratitude or anything. 

He says he cares about me but whenever i am not there or i am busy, he doesn't even call, he just sends SMS saying that he loves me and that he's waiting but only when he has money to send that SMS, if he doesn't, he won't even arrange any money from anywhere, he only will wait for me on whatsapp. Basically if i uninstall whatsapp or block him, he won't try to contact me on any other platform or even call. This relationship has taken a toll on my mental health, it hurts and breaks my heart to see that i have done so much for him and he cant even send one SMS from his own money...


Every month i send him money for himself and money to recharge his phone balance separately. If i don't recharge his phone, he will not even try to text me from elsewhere or just arrange some money from somewhere to recharge his phone. All he does is wait on whatsapp and that's it! Im so attached that i see no way out. This man has completely consumed me, i feel so lost, consumed and used all the time. I just feel like he's there with me for money and to come to Dubai, he's not there for ""me""
I feel tired, low, anxious, depressed, sad and just i cant even describe it.


Whenever i think of a breakup, i feel so anxious and i feel like my heart's gonna stop, seriously this is exactly how i feel towards a breakup. Im scared that if i stop talking to him, he's gonna ghost me forever and never look back. Never gonna try for me, which is somewhat true, but i just don't wanna witness that, i dont wanna feel that, i don't want that to be true, as i have given my all to him, time, money, tears, feelings, love, everything! Im scared that if i ever broke up with him, how will i know if he's fine or not? How will i overcome my rumination? How will i overcome my anxiety, how will i overcome the whole breakup? Im too scared, im severely severely attached. Please help, thanks!

Had a really bad dream about her today and felt like I had a heart attack,"I’ve been in no contact for a few days. I really do miss her. 

Mentally I feel like the longer she delays things the more I wouldn’t want her back. IF she gets married (which she has told me that she is looking for a spouse), I definitely don’t want her back. I also do feel like this breakup showed me who she is and I really don’t want her. But my dumb heart wants her and hopes that she’ll change. This is where I am at mentally and emotionally

Anyways, the dream I had - I dreamt that I reached out to her and I said “Hey X, I just wanted to ask you if you had moved on?” 

She said “I can’t”

I said “Why?”

She said “because I’m pregnant…”

This is where I started getting really bad chest pain in my sleep.

I said “Huh?” As the thought of her getting pregnant creamed by someone else really made me feel so sick to my stomach. I couldn’t sleep. I felt sick in my sleep and got really bad chest pain. I knew I hadn’t been with her in a while. All sorts of thoughts were flashing through my head

You know how dreams can be weird - well she said “No, it’s your baby…”

And with that, I woke up abruptly.

Still feel a bit weird today icl. I miss her, I wanna reach out but I feel like I can’t since she dumped me and told me that “would rather not have me come to ask her parents to marry her”.

Should I break no contact to let him know I have cancer,"I was broken up with 3 weeks ago, it was an 8 year relationship. Started dating in high school and we are now 25. He broke up with me because I had become unmotivated with life and too tired to do anything, which is honestly true. For the past year I’d been sleeping almost 18 hours a day and never had the energy to go out, this made me have to take less classes and fall behind on my degree. We both didn’t want to get married until we had our degrees. My ex graduated and established his career, I slowed down, he saw his friends at work get married and begin having kids. He wanted that, but I wasn’t prepared for it yet. My ex said it felt as though he was already single because I’d be sleeping instead of spending time with him. He constantly accused me of purposefully avoiding him. 

I don’t blame him for breaking up with me, he deserves a partner that is present. I moved back in with my parents and recently saw a doctor about my tiredness and some other weird things that started happening around the same time, and well things started moving fast. Basically my oncologist thinks I have lymphoma and my health is very bad, they want me to do a long hospital stay for treatment but I haven’t gone to admit myself yet. 

I’m so conflicted. Having lymphoma would explain why I’ve been constantly sleeping and unable to function. I want my ex to know I wasn’t doing it on purpose. But I also do not want it to seem like I’m trying to manipulate him into taking me back out of pity. If you were my ex in this situation, would you want me to tell you?

I think I'd appreciate the honesty and transparency but that's just me. Maybe you can make it clear that you're not trying to get back together but at least wanted him to know that it wasn't laziness, you recently discovered it was medical. ||| I will try to say this gently, but I really hope you focus on yourself and your health, treatment and recovery, and not on trying to revive your relationship, even if you do tell him your condition. It may be tempting to try to regain a sense of normalcy through trying to rekindle your relationship, but perhaps there is a reason the relationship ended before you found out you’re ill. Put yourself first. Because he certainly did and will continue to. ||| If sleeping 18 hours a day didn’t raise any flags besides laziness for him then I’d just focus on my own health and recovery and let him find out through word of mouth or something. Seems like that is better if the goal is to make him feel dumb for how he reacted. ||| My question to you is what is the outcome from telling him that you are looking for? Perhaps it would be best to focus on your health. You may not get the response you want from him. It may end up causing more pain than need be at this time. If you feel you really need to tell him then I would say do what feels right for you. But I wouldn’t want you distraught because your ex simply says he’s sorry and that’s about it.  Let’s say it even went the other way. After telling him he stays in contact while you’re on your journey. Perhaps staying in contact knowing he is well and merry, out and about could cause some resentment. Or perhaps he shows up to support you at first but then leaves you behind once more.  How likely would telling him anything better your situation, other than lifting his guilt? Maybe it would make his guilt worse.  I would consider the pros and cons of each angle. Only you know the depths of your relationship with him. But you have to remember to put yourself first now. Keep friends and family close.  I wish you the best of luck. I cannot imagine what you are going through. I hope all of the light comes your way. And may you cherish each and every day. 🫶🏻❤️🍀 ||| I agree with other commenter.

I love you stranger. ||| First, I am very sorry about your medical condition. Please don't delay and get treatment ASAP!!  Second......since the breakup was only 3 weeks ago, I would be concerned that if you told him now, he would think that you were faking or trying to manipulate him. So maybe wait a few more weeks. But do tell him eventually.  I hope you get treatment soon and that the treatment is successful. Please let us know how it goes. ||| I would wait for the final word and then tell him! My ex had cancer and I found out via friends and it was a really weird experience. I would have rather he just told me directly! ||| If I had a terminal illness, I would want to be surrounded by people who love me and actively chose to be there for me through everything.

Am I ever gonna change?,"I am 39 years all , straight men. I met a girl last year she is 35.
She has a child and she has dated a lot , she has experience and looking for someone mature that brings peace to her life. She is no longer dating or just fucking around.

She is beautiful,  tall, has some major surgery  done in the pass as well ( her ass and stomach), however she is not that strick about diets or body to be the main thing,  she is pretty normal. ( huge ass).

Im good looking too, its easy for me to get laid. I have brains as well. Condident, IT engineer , live  alone and proud owner of two cats.

I'm against cheating, and I have had long relationships , still friend with some ex ( no drama).

I never had a relationship this toxic . it's my first time, I love her. it's been more than a year, but we have had more breakups than any other woman in my life.

So for example, the last fight was cause a friend of her was touching her legs in a really sexy way . I dont think he knew we were together. After 2 hours of that shitty behavior, I said, "" Well, why dont you go with him?"" ..yes like a jelous child. Yes she allowed it , however she was always checking on me , hugging me etc etc ..it seem like they are really good friends and she wont even notice this guy touching her..like she did not care (she is never like that, she does not  like people touching her) .

So maybe they had their past I dont know  

But that was just a sample, she got upsed and we broke up again.

I feel deeply sad , I know this is toxic. But in the good days we love each other so much. We are living each day at the fullest. She brings joy to my life.

Is there any hope? I feel like Im living a Johnny Cash and June type of toxic love , I ack like a jealous idiot with her.

I wonder what would it take for me to stop, have a little chat withmyself and then act. I which I was better prepared before reacting,  feel like if I was a mountain in that sense. I miss her but at the same time if I get close to her we will repeat patterns.

I understand its her fault also, she should have stop the guy,  even if I was not there. Im not trying to defend her, just saying that when I complained she was getting ready to go home with me, we could have fuck like crazy . But my fragil ego had to open my mouth. Is there a real path to become a men that is really ready for whatever situación a toxic  woman brings at 2am in a bar
.I feel like I should be more mature, in the moment I tried to hold my thoughts and I think that's the issue..I wait and then explode.

Any books , techniques,  recomendacións I'd appreciate,  anything that gets me there to be that men.  .

I really want her back, I never been more decided with a woman before but it seems I am not in the same level as her.

I know this is little info, but she has always point out that I need so much reassurance when she has already chosen me, and I kind of feel dump that she has a point..why am I acting as if she needed to proof that is with me when we are always together.",1,3,2025-06-30 08:22:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo2544/am_i_ever_gonna_change/,39.0,,"If you want to become the man you are supposed to be, that takes self-awareness.

6 months since she broke up with me,I speak to her sometimes we fought a lot after our breakup i still feel worthless despite giving all my efforts both when we were friends and when we were in a relationship whenever I think of her I get anxious my heart starts pounding and my chest tightens when will all this misery stop I'm tired and I just want peace I wanna be happy again I just feel like i didn't deserve love I'm that one person who's always available but there's nobody available for me,2,7,2025-06-30 04:31:25,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnykc0/6_months_since_she_broke_up_with_me/,,,"Hey, I'm sorry. I wanted to let you know you're not alone in the feelings of anxiousness, heart racing and chest tightness. I get those too. It's been 23 days since he broke up with me after 13 years together. Today is his birthday and I can't stop thinking about him even while I'm at work and busy saving someone's life. I want to be happy, but I don't think I can ever be happy again like before.   Unless you're a murderer, a rapist, or a terrorist, everyone deserves love. I felt like I gave more of myself than I got in return and that was okay because I loved him deeply, still do, and always will. I felt like I was always available for him - to help him, love him, and support him. But he did not reciprocate to the same depths...  You do deserve love.  You deserve peace.  You deserve to be happy.  You deserve someone who is available for you the way you are for them.  Do not think otherwise. ||| Bro, it really pains me how many guys just don’t know how to handle women the right way. I’m seriously thinking about opening a school for this, lol.

break up advice,"me and my girlfriend of two years had to broke up because she’s poly and i’m not. She decided that she don’t want to be in a mono relationship anymore (when we started dating i was clear i’m mono and she was to, it changed) and she won’t let me suffer so we broke up. Now i’m feeling terrible, It's been three weeks, I keep thinking about her, remembering our times together, crying and having panic episodes. We are still in contact, we are honest about our feelings, i know it hurts her too, she also misses me and think about me. My question is how do i get over this?

How do you exactly move on?,"It's only been a day since we broke but this no contact thing is driving me insane. 

I know I need more time to heal but if I'm already in this much pain, how will I survive the other days? I mean, I'm really trying my best to distract myself.

I've been in touch with my friends, I'm playing games, watching movies, listening to music and doing a lot more to distract myself but I would suddenly get this wave of sadness that makes me dissociate from things. 

How do you move on?

Allow time to heal yourself and don't stop doing what makes you happy and improve. It took months to fully move on but it's gonna be easy very slowly in each day. There's no cure and only time and you will heal yourself. Don't rush yourself and take whatever time you need and don't suppress your feelings and let your emotions process. Want to cry? Let it out. Want to shout? Let it out too. You will feel better very soon so keep your heads up.
Unexpected breakup,"I 25m and my girlfriend 22f have never had more than 4 arguments over our entire 5 year relationship. We have lived together the entire time we’ve been together and haven’t spent more than 3 days away from each other. Recently she stayed at her sisters house for 10 days to take care of her animals while she was away on vacation. Seemed a bit odd to me considering she didn’t inform me that she wouldn’t be coming home during that time and it isn’t like her sister lives super far. Her house is literally 5 minutes away from my girlfriends work so whenever I heard that she was going to be taking care of the animals I assumed she’d stop in before work on her lunch break and on her way home but this was not the case. She packed up her stuff nothing unusual just mainly clothes and makeup. And out she went and I’m not going to lie I was pretty salty about the situation but I didn’t say anything because I figured we would make plans to see each other. Fast forward during the week she was away not one time did she try to invite me over, call me, ask about our own animals or have any substantive conversation. I know I’m also wrong for not trying to make plans but I will say it was mainly because I was still hanging on to why she told me the night before she’d be gone for the next 10 days. Anyway one full week after she originally left to go stay at her sisters house she sends me a message expressing that we should break up. And it was not a long thought out message, probably 6 to 7 sentences max and there was only one vague reason that she said was the reason for it. It was that she felt like we had just become “roommates”. Now I didn’t disagree with her about that because we had been in a rhythm in life where things were kinda just slowing down. I told her that I agree with how she feels and that it’s not because the love isn’t there we just haven’t done a good job at putting enough effort into us. I also said that it is something that all relationships go through especially whenever both parties work full time and just wanna get home and relax sometimes. Nevertheless we had a series of conversations that ended off in a better stop than they began and we would start the next day and her vibe would do a complete 180 of how we ended the conversation just the night before. My issue with all this is that she never mentioned how she was feeling before all this started at all. Everyone in our life was dumbfounded when they heard about what is going on. My other issue is that she is completely unwilling to work to fix things one bit, I have been understanding and and reasonable in our talks and she just doesn’t have much to say other than she doesn’t feel the love and that its a gut feeling that even if we do work through things that it’ll just end up back at this point. This whole thing is very out of character for her not just with the way that she’s treated me during it but also how she is closing off other people in her life about talking about it. She is also just carrying on with her life as if nothing is going on at all. I just never saw this coming and I don’t understand why I am not getting solid reasons for this one sided decision and I’m not sure how I’m supposed to handle any of this because like I mentioned before we never fight and this is not normal behavior from her. I keep convincing myself that she’s having some type of mental episode because there are other factors in her life that I know have been really hard for her and I feel like I am the one that is receiving any type of punishment. I’m just really lost right now and wish that I could know what happened the 10 days she was away. There’s also more details I can provide if anyone needs them but yea has anyone had a similar experience or any advice for me?",2,5,2025-06-30 04:20:15,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnydfm/unexpected_breakup/,,10 day(s),"Maybe she is seeing someone else? that would explain her change in behavior and the breakup. ||| Very rough man. My recent ex showed the same odd discard of our relationship. We weren't perfect and we actually did have arguments. But we never yelled or abused eachother, and at the end of every argument we would validate eachother's feelings and move forward in a healthy way together. Or so I thought. One day we were having an argument over text and she broke up with me. Cold, vague, almost like it was all an illusion. Me and her family and mutual friends have believed we were so in love and happy and were gonna get married soon. Then boom, just ends our relationship. No phone call. No in person, one last convo. Just over text. Absolutely shattered me. But almost 2 months later I'm a bit better. I don't think people talk about discards enough. It's not a normal way to breakup at all, and leaves the dumpee dumbfounded and confused. She sounds like an avoidant, look up attachment theory. I would say it's not your fault, because you were willing to work on things and fix things, that shows that you're a healthy partner who understands how relationships work. People like them, that just walk away over things that CAN be fixed, they're the ones dealing with unhealthy ideas of what a relationship is. Granted, everybody has the right to do what makes them happy, but, at the expense of discarding and abandoning someone who put their time effort and loyalty? That's cruel. I hope they find help. ||| I had a similar experience, though I wasn’t living with my girl, but the context was similar. I immediately texted her, tried to talk, but honestly, people don’t realize how much that pushes girls away. We men have to be smart, understand female psychology, and know exactly how to act in these situations. The best strategy is definitely no contact, hands down, combined with self-improvement, digital mirroring, and other tactics. You have to read up on this and educate yourself so that one day she regrets it and you get an unexpected move from her."
What's up with dreams?,"Hello, 

Just coming here to share this very very interesting story of mine. I broke up with my partner of 10 months and we've been NC for 2 months (broken up for 3 months). The interesting part is that I don't dream about them but I pray for them almost daily so that they have a good life. Since I couldn't be the one providing them with all i wanted, I can only entrust them to God. Sometimes during these prayers, I pray to dream about them cause I miss them a lot. The funny part is that the 3 times i did that, i actually dreamed about them but it was a nightmare. All three times i have a dream of them being unfaithful. First time there was a girl telling me to let go and then took me into an abandoned room and showed me s\*x tapes of my ex and told me that they've been unfaithful all along. Second dream was my ex in a car crying and saying that he's hooking up with everyone and gets drunk to do it. Third time today, my ex was happy and was telling me how he finally convinced someone to hookup with them since they've wanted this person for a long time. I wake  up crying every time after these dreams. Idk what to make of them. I think i should take it as a sign that indeed they are unfaithful.

It drains me mentally when I wake up and I cried too as well. I don't think there's a cure for it and time will only cure it. I just cope with it and try to forget my nightmares by doing my morning routine such as early exercise and doing household activities. I hope you're doing well. ||| Sometimes they reflect our fears and pain more than reality. It sounds like your heart is still healing and trying to make sense of what happened.
Advise on this thing..,"Okey here is the thing. I broke up on thursday after 14 months of relationship.  Met her today to return each others stuff. 

A bit about her - she has a kid of 8 years who has adhd. Her ex partner was a narcissist and left her after the kid was born. She has clinical depression and before she met me, she has gone to psych ward a couple of times for self harm. Thankfully she dint go there while we were together. 

We had a good 1.5 hours of conversations today.  She has an avoidant attachment personality. So yeah not very vocal about feelings. 

Whole time in our meeting, she said how she was really happy in the relationship and how she has experienced amazing stuff with me. We are 41M and 43F respectively. We had a more than a normal relationship. However, me being an anxious attachment person find her too dry on the emotional side of it. She took care of me in her own way. 

She is not a cheater or going behind your back kind of person. 

Today she told me ""it was hard to see that i was not able to give you what you needed. I just thought its too much of work and dint have  energy to deal with it. I thought walking away was an easier choice.""

I was surprised to see that she kept a very straight face. While i was getting emotional and all. She only got red face a few times. 

She said ""i am incapable of relationship and i dont think i want another one""

She however suggested that i stay in touch with her so she can check on my emotional well being. She also insisted that we can meet with zero expectation of getting back together. To which i responded that i am not sure if i want that. 

My question - do you think its a good idea to stay in touch with an ex, as a friend? 

Please let me know.  ",1,1,2025-06-30 07:58:12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo1sdv/advise_on_this_thing/,,,"It’s not an easy place to be.

What is grooming actually?,"I F(19) met my ex (M25) when we were 17 and 22. At the time, he was uncomfortable with getting to know me because I was 17. After some boundary setting and talking he did decide to pursue me and we began dating after my 18th birthday. Looking back now, as someone who is about to be 20, I am shocked that this relationship even happened. I could not fathom even going near a 17 year old. At the time of meeting he was into some *different* sexual stuff that he said was a deal breaker for him. Me being 17, naive and “in love” decided that I would also be into the things he was. I committed to fulfilling his fantasies and we were okay. Until he broke up with me, and only got back together with me when he tried dating again and realized most women didn’t want what he did sexually. Almost 3 years later and we’ve broken up again. I’m obviously no longer pursuing him and a month later he was talking to a much older woman whom now he is in a relationship with. Idk I’m doing some soul searching and thinking about 17 year old me, and I just want to shake her. He never loved you, he loved that you were naive and malleable. And then when you became your own person you weren’t enough. It’s so weird. Even stranger is I asked him if this new girl was into it, he said no but he was okay with that. HUH. Like are we being serious? Idk just felt like sharing I guess, my friend said I was groomed. I don’t necessarily think so but. Idk.

The most common form is when a much older person targets a pre-pubescent child with the goal of eventually committing sexual acts with that child. That's obviously not what happened to you.  I do think that your ex-boyfriend exploited your naivete -- but that's something that could have happened almost as easily if you were 18. Young people in their first relationship(s) are prone to being swayed by more experienced partners, it's just something that can happen.

The breakup letter,"
My boyfriend works on the road and is coming home Wednesday, I’m not sure how or when I’m going to tell him it’s over but I know I have to. Idk if this short novel should be kept to myself or shared with him. 

Hey,

I’ve spent a lot of time trying to make sense of things, trying to rationalize your behavior, give you grace, and hold space for your silence. But I’m done doing mental gymnastics for someone who clearly wouldn’t do the same for me.
People make time for what matters. They communicate. They show up. They try. And “I’m working and having a lot things going on” might explain a rough patch but it does not excuse treating me like I’m disposable. Everyone is going through something. Not everyone uses it as a shield to hide from basic decency. Your two weeks away are spent completely absent from the relationship. And then the one week you're home? I end up begging for even a sliver of closeness. It didn’t start this way. In the beginning during your first hitch, even your second, you tried. You called. You texted. You showed up emotionally, even from a distance. I wasn’t asking for constant attention, just connection. Just effort. So no, this isn’t some “she doesn’t understand my job” situation. This isn’t me being needy. This is about the very real, very painful truth that you’ve grown lazy and complacent in this relationship. Now, two months in, you brush me off. You ignore me. You throw out half-hearted excuses that don’t even make sense and I’m supposed to pretend they’re valid just to keep the peace. That’s not partnership. That’s not care. That’s not what I deserve.You’ve made me question my worth, second-guess my instincts, rewrite reality just to justify your inconsistency. That’s not care. That’s not complexity. That’s manipulation dressed up as depth.
I’m done pretending that emotional unavailability is mysterious or profound. It’s not, it’s just cowardice, and I’m no longer romanticizing someone who can’t even treat me with the bare minimum respect they’d give a stranger. That tight feeling in my chest? That spiraling anxiety? That wasn’t me being needy or insecure that was my intuition screaming. And next time, I won’t silence it just to make someone else more comfortable in their romantic laziness. Because when someone says they’re “too busy” or “too complicated” for honesty, what they really mean is: I like access to you without the responsibility of showing up for you. I want the benefits of closeness without the inconvenience of being accountable. I want to be seen as a good guy, even though I’m acting like the opposite.
I was never asking for too much. I was just asking the wrong person.
So this is me choosing myself. If something feels off, it is. If I have to constantly explain away someone’s behavior, I already know the answer. If I’m giving more chances than I’d ever receive, then it’s time to walk away.
Even though what we had was short, my feelings for you were real. I genuinely cared about you, and I was starting to feel hopeful, even excited about what the future could look like with you. That’s what makes all of this so disappointing. Because I wasn’t playing games, and I wasn’t holding back. I showed up with an open heart. I’m saying all of this not to attack you, and not because I need to feel like I have the upper hand. I’m saying it because I genuinely hope you grow from this.  I hope that one day, the next woman in your life gets better from you, more presence, more care, more effort. I hope you understand the part you played, the things you avoided, and the effort you didn’t make. This isn’t about proving a point. I don’t need to be right. I just hope that something in what I’ve said sticks enough for you to reflect, to be real with yourself, and maybe to do it differently next time. Because you could be a great partner… but not if you keep choosing comfort over accountability.

"Love alone isn't enough, you just can't force compatibility","A 4-year relationship just ended with someone I genuinely believed I would build a life with. We were deeply intertwined: emotionally, physically, and practically. We even lived together for several months. But despite the closeness and the love, the relationship ended; not out of hate, betrayal, or a sudden fight, but because the foundation wasn’t sustainable anymore.

He told me he felt like the relationship was full of micro-compromises, from how often we communicated, to sex, affection, sleep routines, and daily decisions. Over time, those adjustments drained his sense of peace and autonomy. He said he realized that while he still loved me, he didn’t want a life that constantly asked him to negotiate himself. That hit hard, but I understood it.

One of the biggest areas of compromise was our sexual compatibility. At the beginning of our relationship, we agreed to explore sexually with others. I tried to embrace that dynamic with him because it made him happy, but I was already starting to feel off about it. Over time, I realized it wasn’t something I wanted anymore, but I kept pushing through because I didn’t want to take something away from him. When I finally expressed that I couldn’t do it anymore, he agreed to stop. That was a big compromise for him.

Then came the aftermath. I had some emotional and sexual trauma from the whole experience, and it led me to doubt our intimacy and even my place as his partner. Eventually, this made me feel unsafe with the idea of him using porn too. So I asked him to stop. And he did. Even though it was a big part of his life and identity growing up, he gave it up because he acknowledged the trauma I carried and wanted to give us peace.

And we were happy again for a while. But I see now that a lot of that peace came from his huge compromises. He kept adjusting and shaping himself into the partner I needed, based on what I asked for, to the point where he was kind of losing himself. He had to negotiate what he actually wanted just to maintain the version of us that I needed.

I also had my struggles. I did feel loved, but only because he was constantly shifting his words, actions, and even his schedule to fit what I needed. I was happy and felt secure because he cultivated a version of himself and created a relationship that allowed me to feel that way, even if it came at the cost of his own comfort and authenticity.

He told me, more than once, actually, that he just doesn’t belong in a relationship anymore. He tried to end things before for the same reasons, and I understand it better now. He wants the freedom to live entirely on his own terms, with no expectations or responsibilities tied to another person. Even if I were to ask for the bare minimum in a relationship, it would still feel like a compromise to him. And that kind of life, one where his peace, his space, and his autonomy are constantly negotiated, just isn’t what he wants anymore.

He said something that stuck with me: “You’re grieving a whole version of your life. But from my side, that version only existed because I kept compromising. We were happy, yes. But it wasn’t sustainable. It was always going to end like this, whether now or later.”

There was no in-between. If we settled and he stopped his compromises, I’d feel unloved. If he kept adjusting, he’d lose himself. The only real solution was letting go. It wasn’t a lack of love. There was so much love. But love wasn’t enough to carry us through fundamental incompatibility. This was the third time we were at the edge of ending things. It just took this long for us to finally accept it.

We still care deeply for each other. We laughed every day, shared so many memories, and genuinely enjoyed each other’s company. But love alone wasn’t enough. You just can't force compatibility.

Right now, I feel like I’m staring at a blank calendar. The relationship took up most of my free time and most of my week. When I wasn’t in school, I was with him. So now that it’s gone, I don’t really know where to start. I don’t know how to rebuild my life or reclaim my time. A lot of the things I enjoyed, even my hobbies, were so tied to him and our routine that it’s hard to know what’s still “mine.” I want to reconnect with myself, but I’m overwhelmed by the space he used to occupy.

I’m trying to be kind to myself and stay grounded. I know healing takes time. I know I’ll be okay. But right now, it’s just hard.

If you’ve been through something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing from you. How did you get through it? What helped you rebuild a life that felt like your own again?",5,8,2025-06-30 00:01:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnthih/love_alone_isnt_enough_you_just_cant_force/,,,">*There was no in-between. If we settled and he stopped his compromises, I’d feel unloved. If he kept* *adjusting, he’d lose himself. The only real solution was letting go.*  This is the theme of most breakups between people with different love languages (or different attachment styles). Neither side is capable of changing such a core part of their personality, and even the slightest compromise feels painful. ||| I was essentially on his end as well. At one point my ex told me ""I feel like all of my relationship are only well as long as im well"" AKA other people keep accepting changes for her well being, and they don't need that back because they can emotionally regulate and know how to accept. Sadly my ex was not emotionally mature enough to realise this at all... no matter in what language I explained honestly...  From what you say, I feel like its the same thing I mention above, you don't know how to heal your triggers and traumas and shift the emotional baggage onto your partner who then needs to adjust. Ive been on the other end of it... And honestly since I assume you were still very loving, that doesn't even hurt that much since the person shifting loves you so much too. As your ex said though... its just not sustainable sadly.  In my case it was unsustainable to the point me and my ex did have a big fight... And according to her thats what broke the relationship. (despite hiding it for me for a month and then blindside discarding me...)  At the end of the day, compromise it definitely not the solution essentially. You must understand compatibility and acceptance. If something passes your line of compatibility then perhaps you can evaluate if you can accept it. If not then you go your own separate ways.   In my opinion compromise works as a temporary band aid... Compromise means, one of the partners is A: Not truly understanding the issue, leading to a sacrifice by the other. Or B: Theres truly and incompatability here that will not be overcome (for example one of you is extroverted and the other introverted, or one is allosexual and the other is asexual. If as a couple there has always been friction between these topics it is likely unsolvable)  So A is solvable... if one of the partners... grows up... (which very often happens after the relationship ends)"

I opened up to you in many ways, that I never do with most, and I accepted you. I knew your story, you had a hard life growing up just like me. And you had no family. I valued our relationship so much. I did and would have been so caring, loving, and loyal to you. You told me you were going to marry me. We would have a family tougher, that that’s all we ever wanted since we came families that were broke. When we would be together, it was always amazing. I felt calm, safe and like I found my soulmate. But then, there was always an issue with time. I asked to see you and spend time with you, you’d say you’d try and sometimes we did and then most of the time there was something that came up on your end. Then you said you are dealing with something and don’t have the time for me right then. I responded back to talk through it all but you never replied… just ghosted me…for 2 months. Then you came back, a couple days before my birthday, trying to rekindle… seeing your name pop up was surprising… I never expected to ever hear from you again… I was hesitant and also confused and hurt. I was already starting to move on and accepting that you didn’t want to be with me anymore… it was a painful process. Then I decided to open up my heart again and give things another chance. Things felt great again, you said how much you missed me and wanted me in your life forever, and that I make you happy… and I felt the same way. Things were fine for a month, then you couldn’t give us the time again. It was always something- work (and I get it), a family member, or other things that you said were taking up your time. I just asked to work through it with you, but you ended up seeming to get tired and just gave up, saying that you don’t have the “proper time” for me. I understand there are priorities in our lives but to not have been able to find time for us just hurt and made me feel like I was at the back burner. For someone who always wanted a family and to marry someone you considered your true person, that made no sense to me. The messages were even beginning to slow/be less, not even a photo of each other like we used to send in between our meets, just to see each other…And then I tried to talk through it with you, asked for a heart to heart. You never replied, until this day. It’s been almost a month now. And then I saw on my feed from our mutual friend that you went on a small trip to see them/ “family”. I get it, but you never had time for us? Not even a day worked? no matter how much I pleaded, felt like I was begging… begging for your time, love and attention. So after seeing that, I deleted you off social media. Because that hurt me so much. And you adding new girls to your socials recently just makes it all settle in… breaking me to complete pieces. You really moved on that fast? How important was I to you? The connection you said was rare and special…yet all I ever did was ask for time, for care, for a future with you? That was a lot to ask for I guess…. I thought I was important to you. I thought you cared about me. Even if things didn’t work, ghosting me yet again after I poured my heart out hurts even more this time around….You have no idea how much this has all broken me internally…. I was so loyal and caring and you meant so much to me…. I haven’t even thought of talking to any other guy, because I had a small glimmer of hope that maybe you’d reach out again and we could work it all out. But not now, you clearly don’t care about me after what I’ve seen…I see how much I truly meant to you…. I am dealing with this pain alone… it’s so hard. It feels so callous of you but I see this is what I needed to finally accept the truth… A part of me thinks that you aren’t truly a bad person and just have things to heal from…and that you did care. But it’s hard to believe after all of this. I feel like everything was a lie… I just feel so broken and am trying so hard to be okay. One day I hope to forgive you. And to heal from this. 😔😢💔",7,1,2025-06-29 20:47:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnp5sb/letter_to_my_ex/,,2 month(s),"To add on: We were not LDR, maybe 20-30 min away. Our situation was slightly complicated with living situations. But we also didn’t work too far from each other (25-30 min commute). Yet we would only see each other 1-2 times a month. Never called. Text was our only life line. And when he came around the second time he said he thought things over and was going to make more time for us since I matter so much to him. Started strong then it went down again to the same thing. He wouldn’t even follow up sometimes with the day we were meeting I’d have to mostly ask when are we meeting again and confirm it last minute when I preferred to plan a bit in advance. And we were together dating for about 1.5 years. So it truly hurts a lot. It seems like such a simple thing that Cooke have been fixed but also he wanted to prioritize everything else so I felt like how important am I to him or was I just a convenience or an escape for him….. saying in person that he was for sure going to marry me and talking about a future and family almost every time we’d see each other just made me so confused when he wanted to take time… I also told him I have a timeline for when I wanted to have kids since I’m getting old and he’s older than me too, so don’t want us to raise kids too late in age. So not sure why he would prolong that further if we were dating 1.5 years and felt strong about each other - same values, connection, etc all aligned. So it just hurts because it makes me feel like it was all a lie since it doesn’t make sense…."
I’m Still Not Over my Breakup and I Feel So Guilty About It (21M),"Hello,

So a little bit of context: 
I’m currently in a bit of a bind. I’m in nursing school right now, and I’ve been stressed out of my mind with the paperwork. At the time, me and my my then-girlfriend now ex (21F) were on a for 3 month break because she had kind of a mental breakdown after coming down from her university upstate to visit me. We were together for 4 and a half years; she was my longest relationship ever and we met as seniors in highschool. Before coming down, she had just been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and it culminated in her snipping off a piece of my cat’s fur with scissors that almost made me kick her out of my house entirely. 

Anyway, we had a 3 month long break, which I decided to end after finishing my OB/Peds final and got back in contact with her. She was kind of distant and didn’t really want to talk to me, but I gave her space. Eventually, she said she felt better on the break and I concurred. Despite some things like her wanting to move on, I considered it a pretty smooth, mutual breakup. Deleted all mentions of her, cut contact, the whole shebang and felt nothing. 

Not long after, I downloaded a bunch of dating apps and I found a lovely girl that I am so glad to have met. We’ve been dating since March and things have gone really well. Which is why I feel guilty, especially since I absolutely cannot talk about this with her.

About two weeks ago, I started watching Steven Universe with my friends and something about that show pulled repressed feelings about the breakup out of me. After certain songs/episodes, I started having reoccurring nightmares about my ex. Waking up in her bed beside her, reconnecting with her, but it all felt…wrong. And the nail in the coffin is that I found old photos, voicemails, videos, etc. from when we were in highschool that I thought I had deleted. Now, I can’t stop thinking about her even though I know what we had wasn’t perfect. 

I met her at a point in my life where I didn’t really have direction and she provided me with that direction. I wouldn’t be in nursing right now, if not for her. But, she also made me feel like I needed to repress parts of myself to be her partner. I can’t in full confidence say that she was a terrible person, just that there was a lot of stuff going on between the two of us that was healthy and wasn’t healthy. 

But, all of this contemplation has made me feel terrible because I’m with a wonderful person who loves me and I’m here stuck in my own head. I thought I got it out of my system, thought I was over it completely. Now, all of these feelings have resurfaced and I don’t know what to do. What I do know for sure is that I am NOT getting in contact with her again.

I want to heal and be better for the woman that I’m with now, she deserves everything and more. I just feel so worried that I’m going to get trapped in my own head and miss what’s important NOW.

Struggling to let go after 13 years together — torn between history and healing,"Hi everyone,  
My therapist suggested I try opening up in a space like this. I’m in the middle of an emotional tug-of-war since separating from my ex — the person I’ve been with for 13 years. We started dating when I was 16. We never married but we have two kids together and a long, complicated history. Over the years, we’ve broken up and gotten back together more times than I can count.

Last summer, I left. He told me he was ready to change, and I still loved him, so I moved back in. But within a couple of weeks, I knew I’d made a mistake. I stayed until the week before Christmas, despite feeling severely depressed — like I was losing my will to keep going.

I’ve made mistakes in our relationship. I struggled with addiction, and there was infidelity in the past. But I’ve been in therapy and working with psychiatry since 2017. I’ve done — and continue to do — the work to become a better version of myself.

He once apologized and admitted that during my lowest points, he would “rub my face in the dirt.” That has stuck with me. I’ve been out of the house since December. I’ve started dating someone new — someone kind, consistent, and supportive of me and my kids. He shows up in ways my ex never did. I can see a future with him. But despite that… I still feel emotionally tied to my ex.

My family and friends call him manipulative — some even say he’s narcissistic. And a lot of times, I agree. When I read back through my journals about the things he said and did, it’s honestly disturbing. No one should have to endure that. But then he swears he’s changed. He says he’s not that person anymore — and now he’s planning to give this “new version” of himself to someone else. That’s been hard to sit with.

He recently told me he’s getting close to giving another woman his “loyalty” and is making a decision soon. And honestly, I think I need to respect that. But it hurts. I had always hoped that if we were ever going to try again, it would be with intention — with therapy, growth, and accountability. I’ve told him I still get anxious and uneasy around him. Almost every time we talk, I walk away feeling confused or emotionally scrambled.

But he doesn’t want therapy. He says we should just “naturally find our way back” — and that I’m too demanding now, that my standards are too high, and it’s probably too late because I didn’t give him a real chance when I left. Meanwhile, I’m working full-time, raising our kids, going to nursing school, and dating someone who actually wants to build a life with me. But I’m still stuck in this emotional loop, wondering what if.

I think the hardest part is the guilt. I left because of the emotional abuse. But part of me still believes maybe he treated me that way *because* I was such a mess back then. Like it’s somehow all my fault.

If anyone’s ever been in a similar place — stuck between knowing it’s over and still feeling like you can’t let go — how did you move forward? How do you accept that it’s really done, even when you gave so much of your life to someone?

I M22 want my ex F23 back,"I “M22” am still in love with my ex girlfriend “F23” from 2-3 years ago. We only dated for 1 year

These thoughts are ruining my life, I don’t think things are repairable as we’ve both become such different people and I don’t think the direction she wants to go with her life aligns with mine but I can’t shake the thought of her. I’ve been in a couple relationships since but she’s always been on my mind somewhere deep down. 

I always consider calling her but I think it would make things too awkward as I still see her at parties and social gatherings and I know our mutual friends would all say it’s a bad idea.

We didn’t end on bad terms and we still get along but I yearn for her and have everyday for the past few years. 

It all sounds super corny but I just can’t see a point in going on with my life if it’s not with her.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated ",1,1,2025-06-30 06:56:26,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo0vn5/i_m22_want_my_ex_f23_back/,,1 year(s),"Whatever is meant for you will always find its way to you. If she’s the one for you then it’ll happen. Could also be that you haven’t found a good fit since your breakup, but there are other people that you can connect with. Just takes time. Sometimes lots of time. Enjoy your life; you’re young. If you truly feel like you can’t go on without trying, then tell her how you feel. But I encourage you to give it more time"
How do I deal with the fact that my ex's bday is coming up and I'm not able to wish her,"Ex is my immediate neighbour. Her bday is in 2 days, and we've been in no contact since 7 months (I'm blocked everywhere except maybe if I create fake email IDs). Relationship was good while I was in the same town, but I moved places to study abroad and we tried being in touch but had to part ways. It went downturn as she failed in academics, and I am the one to blame as I didn't give her space and understanding enough to go into no contact immediately after the break.
Unfortunately she's the loml, and I refuse to believe else. I dream of her since 7 months, observe her Instagram profile from afar and take life updates. Tried seeing other women but didn't want it, just wanted to see her smile so I've made up my mind to wait for her marriage so I may finally see someone else. Her parents asked her to maintain no contact and she's adhering to her wishes, while I've gone suicidal, depressed and made my parents sad. I tried reaching out to her 4 months ago but her mum told me the police will get involved if I come any closer to them. I dream of her every night and its not possible for me to move on just so now, i just am perpetually sad. I thought of wishing her on her bday via a mutual, but mum and my aunt think this will cause her trauma. I'll have to see her celebrating her birthday from my house, meanwhile I'll be crying that night. I came back to the city just to find a job and be near her.


Edit : have been in therapy since 7 months, im 24M she's turning 22. Its just the thought of not being able to even say hi without risking the cops at my doorstep is killing me.",1,7,2025-06-30 06:55:53,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lo0vcw/how_do_i_deal_with_the_fact_that_my_exs_bday_is/,,,"That sounds really bad. It sounds like you have a obsession over her. Seriously it sounds like an obsession and your presence is hurting her. I highly suggest therapy and let her live with her own life without you. The fact that she blocked you everywhere means she doesn't want to see you or talk to you anymore. ||| I am blocked by my sweetheart asw only because i said her to stay away from smoking..I just asked our mutual friend to wish her from my side ||| She has made it clear that she does not want to hear from you, so you should not wish her a happy birthday. You would be invading her personal space and disrespecting a boundary."
Realizing she was checked out of the relationship way before it ended,"I know it seems obvious that if someone breaks up with you it’s because they’ve thought about it for a while, but it just hurts still. 

We were long distance and the breakup was mutual. Ultimately we weren’t good for each other and we both have a lot of growing to do on our own. I won’t get into specifics but I really believe I did my best throughout the relationship in every way but it never seemed enough for her. Then she’d apologize for making me feel like I’m not enough for her, then not change her ways. 

I gave too much of myself over to the relationship, which I know is my fault, and I wouldn’t blame her if she found it to be too much, but when I tried to do things for myself like work out and eat well and be more social she would get irritated. In the moment she always seemed glad, but she later told me she got a strange irritation whenever I would tell her about those things. And she knew it was wrong to feel that way. But she still did. I never understood that. It made me feel like I couldn’t tell her many things if she was secretly getting irritated if I mentioned how much I’m enjoying the gym or something. 

I started seeing a therapist and after the first session went really well, I wanted to tell her about it. She told me she didn’t need to hear about it because if she was in therapy she’d keep it all to herself. I get that of course, but this first session I had was literally just me and the therapist getting to know each other. I never understood that either even when I asked why. 

She admitted to me a couple months ago (we broke up two weeks ago) that she felt she had been taking me for granted, and that immediately made me cry. I’m a pretty emotional guy, so when I heard her say something that I didn’t even know I needed to hear so badly, the river started running. 

Looking back, I have realized all the times I felt the best in the relationship were times when she would apologize to me for making me feel a certain way or for saying something mean. I know that sounds awful but it’s true. The rest of the relationship (even though I didn’t fully realize it) felt kind of suffocating and when those moments of clarity came it was like christmas. She could be pretty mean to people she loved (including her family) due to her anger issues. 

Anyway, I could go on and on but I guess I’m just now realizing that she truly was checked out of the relationship for a while and never had the fucking balls to just tell me. She was dropping these hints and I guess I always ignored the implications because it scared me (which is wrong of me I know). I just feel almost used and taken for granted and wildly disrespected. 

We made a clean cut after the breakup and haven’t spoken at all. We said we’d like to hear from each other at some point so we can see how we’ve been. Because we do truly care about each other, but now I do not want to speak to her any time soon at all. 

I just feel slighted. I didn’t deserve that. After 2.5 years together and having feelings for each other for 5 years, I didn’t deserve that. I know it’s all in the past and I can’t change it now, I just feel sad. 

Any words or thoughts are wholly welcome. Thanks. 

PS this has been a great sub to browse whenever I’m feeling particularly down or lonely because it immediately reminds me that so many people are going through the same thing. It’s hard to remember that for me sometimes since I’m 21 and still learning to navigate life, but yeah. Thank you.

Miscarriage then breakup,"Miscarriage and engagement ring given back

Ps I can fill in more info if needed this is just a start 

Backstory 

Was engaged to my
Fiancé who has three children from a horrible relationship and her husband who was my friend who has been passed away. 

We had been planning on getting married in a month and I am basically a father to these kids.

Our relationship has been really good, has its struggles of course but overall healthy and rewarding!

Father’s Day I got a card and a pregnancy test and we found out we were expecting 

It said parenting is and adventure 

Mind you 

We’ve lost two already

As of Monday (6 days ago) she started bleeding and having cramps again and was distraught as was I 

We held eachother and I reassured her of all things

It wasn’t her fault 
It’s okay to be feeling all the things 
And if we can’t have kids I’m okay with that we have three already etc etc 

Came home in the morning yesterday to my ring and a letter stating her body is done and she can’t go through this again it’s destroyed her and it’s not fair to me to not be able to experience the birth of a child. 

I’m hurting and worst of all I know she’s hurting

Love is a weird feeling but don't lose sleep over it.,"No matter how strong you are, there was a relationship that almost took you to the mental hospital. You don't really understand how much damage love can do until you find yourself questioning your own sanity. There was a time when you were unbreakable, confident, stable, sure of yourself.

And then came that one person, the one who knew exactly how to pull you in and tear you apart at the same time.

They didn't just hurt you. They made you doubt yourself. They made you feel like you were the problem. Like your feelings were too much, like your love wasn't enough.

You lost sleep, you lost weight, you lost yourself. One day you were laughing and dreaming about a future together and the next you were staring at the ceiling trying to make sense of the chaos in your mind.

Every argument felt like a battle for your sanity. Every silent treatment felt like suffocation.

You kept telling yourself that love was supposed to be hard sometimes, but deep down you knew this wasn't love.

It was survival. And the worst part, walking away didn't immediately fix it.

The damage stayed long after they were gone.

You had to relearn how to trust, how to breathe, how to exist without feeling like you were constantly on edge.

But you made it.

Somehow, despite everything, you found the strength to pull yourself out of that darkness. And now when you look back, you don't see weakness, you see survival. Because no matter how close you came to breaking, you're still here.",20,5,2025-06-29 13:54:57,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnf9ag/love_is_a_weird_feeling_but_dont_lose_sleep_over/,,,"I recognize myself a lot in these words, they are true…  THANKS ||| thank you for this ||| Exactly, that resonates a lot with what I went through. ||| that wasn’t love   that was emotional war disguised as connection  and surviving it?   that’s not healing   that’s step one  next step is refusing to ever explain your worth to someone who only listens to pain ||| This speaks to the deepest parts of me still stitching themselves back together.

My (36M) girlfriend (31F) of 6 years broke up with me today on the anniversary of of my mother’s death. I don’t know what to do,"My I guess ex now broke up with me today after coming home from a trip to see her family and friends. We’ve lived together for about 4 years and have had a pretty good relationship for the most part, the same ups and downs most couples have and we’ve worked on our issues whenever they’ve come up. We’ve been talking about getting married and there have been some issues there. She’s not sure she wants kids or not, I do but I’m not fanatical about it and could just as easily not. I’m 37 in two weeks so at this point I feel like if it happens great, if not, fine. I’m also Jewish and she isn’t and that’s been a sticking point but not a massive one and I’ve communicated that. A couple hours after she got home she started being cryptic and I point blank asked her if she was wanting to break up and she said yes. I don’t, I love her more than anyone, she’s my best friend and my home.

Okay fine typical breakup I guess, but here’s where it’s really killing me.

1. We live together in a state neither of us are from and have no friends or family here. The closest friends or family being a 7 hour drive to the next state over, and we have 6 months left on our lease and neither can just afford to leave. 

2. My family is a complicated thing, so skipping the unnecessary details, I was adopted at 13 by my former foster mother who had been so because my birth mother was severely mentally ill and adopted me later for the same reason though i maintained a relationship with my birth mother even though my adoptive mother was every bit a mother to me. My birth mother died…uh…by her own hand (don’t want to upset anyone) and today is the anniversary of her death. Also worth noting that my adoptive mother passed away unexpectedly two years ago this October. I have no other family outside of two half siblings i don’t have a relationship with, and an uncle  i also don’t have a relationship with. The fact is my family is gone. My gf’s family had taken me in basically and now i have no one, and it’s all happening on the day that I memorialize the loss of my mom.

3. I have two dogs, one of whom we rescued “together” (before we moved in together but while we were dating) as a 6 week old puppy, and my other dog i had before she and i met but she was still basically a puppy. This might actually be the hardest part for me. In 6 months my ex and i are going to go our separate ways and these dogs who, have really only ever known her and me, will be losing her. One day for a reason they can’t understand, she’s going to go away and they’ll never see her again and that part is breaking my heart almost as much as losing the love of my life and my best friend. I don’t know how to handle this part especially. They don’t react well when she leaves to go home for a few days, they don’t eat, they stay by the door, they don’t want to play. My sadness is just beginning but theirs is still six months away and it’s killing me.

I feel like my entire world and my future has been obliterated and I have to live in the wreckage for half a year and then I have to say goodbye to my best friend and I have to see my dogs deal with the abandonment. I’m very lost, and I would be lying if I said I wasn’t on the edge here. I think maybe the dogs would be happier with her, I could leave them with her and the balance of my savings account to take care of them and I could join my family. I just don’t know how to deal with this. It came completely out of left field and it feels like an actual nightmare that I can’t wake up from. I’ve had breakups before and never like this. They hurt, it sucked, I left and moved on. I can’t imagine how people handle divorce especially with real kids if this is even one tenth of that experience. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. Thank you

Communication Matters - broke no contact. FELT GOOD.,"I’ve been consistently seeking advice online—here on Reddit and even through ChatGPT—about what to do with my boyfriend, who broke up with me but kept giving me breadcrumbs. I was deeply sad during that time, so I turned to others for guidance. The most consistent and solid advice I received was this: don’t contact him, don’t initiate any conversation, and strictly follow the no-contact rule.

I managed to follow that rule for about two weeks—or maybe just a week—despite him sending me consistent breadcrumbs. He’d message that he missed me, that he loved me, but never once did he say he wanted me back. Still, I held on to the advice from Reddit and ChatGPT not to reply, because they were just breadcrumbs—nothing more.

And honestly, it felt empowering. It was incredibly hard—I cried a lot, even dropped to my knees in tears, unable to function properly at work—but it gave me a sense of control. For once, I felt like I had the power. I was the one setting the boundaries, sending the message that things wouldn’t be easy anymore.

But let me tell you this: while I was maintaining no contact, he kept messaging me, saying how much he missed me. And something inside me started to feel unsettled. What if he really had something important to say and I was just ignoring him? What if he needed to say something he couldn’t say unless I responded?

That thought led me to break the no-contact rule. I replied, “Yeah, I miss you too.” And that was the moment he opened up. He told me everything—he apologized, he expressed himself, and he became vulnerable with me.

You see, the no-contact rule works in certain cases—especially when you’ve been mistreated or abused, or when you’ve finally decided you deserve better. It’s helpful when you need to walk away from a relationship that causes more harm than good.

But if you truly love each other, and you’ve simply had a misunderstanding, why torture yourself by strictly following no contact? Communication is essential. Talk to the person. Speak your mind. Be clear with each other instead of sitting in silence and trying to guess what the other person means.

Just communicate. Respond to the message. And if that conversation doesn’t bring peace, healing, or respect—then that’s when you stop. At least you tried. At least you listened. And what you hear will help guide your next decision.",34,9,2025-06-29 10:42:51,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnbouv/communication_matters_broke_no_contact_felt_good/,,,"This part. The world isnt black and white. I wish my ex would give me some closure. ||| No contact is something I suggest for those who have been dumped. It doesn’t mean don’t respond to contact from your ex. It’s advice to not contact your ex FIRST with stories of how your love is undying and you’re falling to pieces without them. That’s not going to bring someone back. What may bring them back is an acceptance on your part and moving on with your life without drama (I told my wife I really didn’t want to separate when I moved out and said nothing else so the door was open to ask me if I felt the same 6 months later).  So by all means respond if the person who dumped you reaches out. My wife had sought therapy and was in a much better headspace and we have been back together for over 4 years now. ||| In your case, I am glad that contact worked.  If love can continue and thrive - go for it! ||| What if its neither. What if its right people, unhealthy brains. Getting help and experiencing stuff we need to before before ready to settle down. We couldn't be friends when we tried to reconnect the first time I put down Cut contact. Now she put it down and it feels more permanent. But I love her too much to be comfortably friends again so soon, because no hate was born from the pain. No matter how much I tried. Breaking cut contact is me not respecting her needs. She said bluntly she can't do casual with me the emotions are too real and she needs that casual era as well as lots of therapy. How am I going to keep her in my heart but keep her away? Its sucks! Im trying to live for myself, but I wake up from dreams of us falling asleep next to eachother, only in an empty bed. I hope I can move on someday, or I may never be able to be her friend until something truly hurts me. ||| no contact isn’t religion   it’s a reset   and if someone shows up with actual substance, not just signals   yeah, break it  you didn’t fold   you checked the temperature   and this time, he met you there  just don’t mistake vulnerability for change   watch what *stays* consistent now   not just what felt good once ||| How do you break no contact though if your ex literally blocked you on everything?"
The Hardest Part Was That I Meant Nothing,"It still breaks my heart to think about how easily he could give up on me, like I was just nothing... just a  chapter he could close without a single thought. How do you walk away from someone you claimed to love without even fighting? Without looking back?How could you give up so easily? How did you not find a single reason to stay? You moved on so easily like I am never a part of your life... The pain isn't just in the leaving... it's in the realization that I meant so little that he didn't thought for a second. Nothing is harder than trying to act normal after losing contact with someone who was part of your daily life.

I'm trying to accept it, to let him go, but some days the weight of it all crashes down on me. How could I forget that he just abandon me.... How could I forget that when I am loosing sleep over him, he is sleeping with whole other girl on his mind...How could I forget that when I am sitting just staring at my phone, he is already on a phone with other girl....How could I forget that when I am crying alone he is making other girl smile...How could something so special for me be so disposable to him? The silence hurts more than the goodbye. The walk away feels like a betrayal. And yet... here I am, still holding on what we were, while he's already moved on like it was nothing. Maybe the hardest part isn't even the loss it's knowing that I would've stayed. I would've fought. I would've chosen him.

But he chose to let me go without a second thought. And that... that shatters me in ways I don't know how to heal from. So I'll cry.. But one day, I'll wake up and the weight won't feel so heavy. One day, I'll stop wondering why I wasn't enough for someone who was never meant to stay. Until then... I'll let myself feel it all, bcz the love was real for me, even if it wasn't for him....",14,9,2025-06-29 15:51:16,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnhyz1/the_hardest_part_was_that_i_meant_nothing/,,,"Idk if holds true for you, but someone told me if you truly love someone and wants nothing but the best for them, they get fed up and start calling you toxic to justify what they did.

Post break up overthinking,"Hi, 24M just got out of a serious 2 1/2 year relationship. Our relationship had a lot of ups and downs and the downs have been ruining me and mental health. Decided to break up and it’s been hard but I’ve been coping.

Now I’m in the this weird phase like I need someone to talk to me and like me. It’s been about 2 1/2 weeks now since the break up. I think I have a lot of self love but I just feel like I sit in silence a lot and it drives me crazy. I’m thinking of getting tinder again to just start talking to people but I feel like it’s too early and might be corny for me to do at 24. I’m going through a lot of overthinking and just think I’ll never be loved the same again. I just feel ugly so much even though I know I’m not. But yeah, head battle right now. Has anyone felt this and what have you done to help break this thought process? ",2,4,2025-06-30 01:54:03,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnvoqx/post_break_up_overthinking/,,,Im doing the same thing and im 6 weeks out. This subreddit doesnt help ||| I hear you man. I was emotionally starved just before the break up and now I’m even more. I feel like I need to be distracted or talked or something just to not sit in silence in my own thoughts. My head hurts from overthinking and self esteem issues. The worry about not being loved again is haunting me.
My Ex contacted my other Ex HELP!,"This is the single most violating thing I’ve ever felt, and being that there isn’t anything else on google search on reddit, I decided to post. For starters, I am (34m) and both of my Ex’s (31f the recent ex) and (35f) broke up with me. 35 and I broke up back in January. We didn’t stop talking until march, it was not like we were speaking romantically, just having conversations about our day. We broke up in january, but we’d been not seeing eachother much since november. When I met my recent ex 31f I formally cut it off with the other ex 35f (ended communication). 

My recent ex 31 and I met in march. Much of the relationship was me dealing with deep rooted insecurities, abandonment issues and (despite fighting me about this) is a fearful avoidant but doesn’t know. I spend an incredible amount of time dealing with being called a manipulator and a gaslighter. Granted, the accusatory nature of our arguments caused me to spiral (get flustered, get confused, have my avoidant tendencies come out) This is pretty typical of fearful avoidants especially trying to get them to address issues, take accountability, or understand your perspective. 

Anyway, my recent ex 31 and I broke up a week ago or so. The short of it is we technically broke up a week earlier, I sent over my grievances since I felt like I wasn’t being heard and accepted it. She broke up with me, blocked me on everything and then reached out to my other ex 35. I only know this because my recent ex 31 unblocked me to call me a horrible person a gaslighter and a manipulator because of what she had “learned”. I sent her a message on another number, saying I’m sorry it ended I’d be here to talk about whatever it was she was talking about when she was ready. Really polite just asking her to please not make it messy. She called me names and blocked that number.

The other night my recent ex (31) she unblocked me and sent me audio recordings and photos my other ex had saved I guess.  I was in absolute shock because this was an insane violation of trust. On both of their ends. I tried to give both of them closure. Ultimately they ended the relationships not me. I send the non recent ex (35) an audio recording apologizing for my part in the relationship (although I’d tried to give 35f closure. And it didn’t go well or at least wasn’t fufilling but 1. She’s not entitled to anything. 2 I tried. And 3. She was the one that checked out and pulled away.) I also set the boundary that I was going to ghost both of them if this continued. But was open to dialogue to try and chill this situation out as I’ve known 35f since highschool and we were good friends then. 

To be honest though, I not only had the thought to block both of them but also file a restraining order (I don’t think it’s reached that level though)

Regardless of my communication issues and problems I unfairly brought into the relationship. I treated both of them really well. Really was a rockstar boyfriend to both of them. They took me for granted, they stop respecting me, and they left. I accepted both of the breakups. 

I understand the crossover between both of them and one ending and the other beginning overlapped. But the first one 35f, was over long before I cut off communication. 

I haven’t heard anything since I sent the audio message. I know there isn’t anything I can do. I don’t want to be with 35f, haven’t been since the breakup. and 31f I’ve tried to be understanding of her issues but up until I got that message I thought maybe we could reconcile. Right now I’m at 1 in a million of that happening because lets be real, if no boundaries exist in a relationship it isn’t a relationship. And the chances of someone seeing what they’ve done and taking accountability for it and healing as a person is 1 in a million.  So I think it’s gonna be a no from me

Just wanted the communities thoughts. Because I’ve never heard of anything like this before but this is incredibly out of character for 35f, and I’ve known her for nearly 2 decades. And the other one I haven’t known long enough, but I was absolutely crazy about the girl. Absolutely blindsided by this and want some advice.

Also, she got my ex’s number because she made me block her, and I guess took the number down. (Insecurities)

I’m being called a liar and a manipulator which I don’t care about, I know my truth but like why is there no respect? No boundaries? Just trading shots for sport is honestly sick.

One last point of clarity, I didn’t want to be with 35f although she broke up I was feeling like it in the weeks running up (she didn’t show up to Christmas although she was a few blocks away) we just weren’t right for each other. Good friends. But not right

it's been two weeks,"[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/s/XUIiczHP0x)

Today marks two weeks since we broke up.

It's been tough. The first couple of days I was an absolute mess, and now 14 days in, I still kind of am.

It does get easier. But it also gets harder. Everyone who tells you the weight gets a little easier to bear with each passing day is right, but as that weight is lifted I'm beginning to feel an emptiness. Any joy I've found recently is fleeting. There's a void left in my heart, an absence in my life that I feel so deeply.

I think about her all the time. When I think about her too much, I cry. 

I cry for what we lost and what could've been.
I cry for all of the things I still wanted to do with her, that now may never be.
I cry because I miss her so desperately.

I just want my best friend back.

The last time we saw each other was one week ago, so we could talk and get a bit more closure. She still loves me, and I still love her so much. She just isn't ready to commit, and she feels she can't give me everything I need. That she can't give me all of the attention I deserve, and that she can't love me as much as I love her. I told her she was enough, but she said she didn't want to just be ""enough"". She was my first relationship, and she felt like I couldn't know what was ""enough"" for me without having the chance to experience a relationship that could give me more than she can right now. She felt like she was robbing me of experiencing that. I told her I still love her, and she said if that's still true in a few years, we can check on that.

The hardest part about this breakup is it does feel... necessary. For both of us to grow, this had to happen. In these past two weeks I realized I was relying on her to be whole, relying on her to be happy. I grew complacent with a lot of things in my life as my life began to revolve around hers, rather than us revolving around each other. She was the center of my universe, and as circumstances had it I was not the center of hers. I need to be the center of my own universe.

I feel like once we've both grown more, we have a chance at trying again in the future. It's a paradoxical thing though, as in order for that to be even a remote possibility I need to fully move on. I need to let go of that possibility if it's to ever happen. I need to open myself to other people, and I need to be okay with her being with other people. It hurts, imagining her with someone else. And when I imagine myself with someone new, all I can foresee is myself comparing them to her.

Long distance ghosting / blocked,"I talked to a girl for almost two months. We FaceTimed nearly every day and got emotionally close. We opened up to each other, shared personal stories, made each other laugh, and talked about what it would be like to finally meet in person. She lives in Vancouver, and I live in Calgary. Eventually, we made a plan for me to visit her. She invited me to stay at her house, and just two days before my flight, we confirmed everything. We even had a call to go over expectations and rules for staying at her place. She told me about a restaurant she wanted to take me to. She also told her parents and her sister about me, and her sister even saw me on FaceTime. We made a detailed schedule for the trip, and about a week before my flight, she told me she missed me and that she couldn’t wait to see me.

Then, four hours before my flight, she suddenly said her feelings had changed and that I couldn’t stay at her place no matter what. She had hours  even days to tell me sooner, but she waited until the last possible moment. I was shocked, but I still got on the plane, thinking maybe we could talk or figure things out in person. But when I landed in Vancouver, she ghosted me completely. Shortly after, she blocked me on everything  my number, my social media, every way to reach her. She knew exactly when my flight landed, and she chose to cut me off right after I arrived, knowing I had nowhere else to go.

I can’t help but feel like there may have been someone else involved. She said a “friend” was over the night before, and her entire energy shifted out of nowhere. After two months of closeness, daily conversations, and confirmed plans, she left me completely alone in a new city without explanation or closure. She didn’t just change her mind  she waited until it would hurt the most. That’s not confusion. That’s deliberate. That’s not how you treat someone who cared about you.

First Breakup… bf cheated,"My partner (M27) and I (F24) broke up today. I found out through a Facebook “Are we dating the same guy” post my co-worker sent me. My partner and I were at the store, and I received a text with a screenshot of his social media + the Facebook post. 

Long story short, after we were out of the store and in the car I asked and he denied it, we got to my house and he came clean and admitted to it. 

We’ve been together for 4 years and he cheated on me twice with the same person this past September. 

I don’t know what to do, I love him still and want to be friends, and ultimately want to get together, but I just don’t know if I can or should. The fear of losing such a big part of my life sucks. 

I don’t want to bash him to my friends or anything because I think there’s a possibility of us reconnecting and I don’t want him to face that stigma if we do. 

Right now I just don’t really feel anything, I’m not mad, I’m not struck with grief, I just want to go to bed.

I guess it's admirable to want to keep the peace. If he does try to come back into your life, I hope you make him earn your trust and respect. ||| This is a time to lean on your friends. I would assume that if you found out this way, they already know. All the women in my city are on that page. If a man I was seeing extremely casually was posted, my friends would let me know.   Nobody can tell you how to feel right now. I would recommend trying to write things out to workout your own feelings. Write down all your questions. And if you can't figure out how you want to handle the situation. Consider, are you thinking of working it out because you genuinely believe you can move on and work through this? Is the relationship worth all the work to get through this? Is the relationship fulfilling you? As well as ""Am I choosing to work through it because it's the easier than the breakup?"" ""Am I just comfortable?""  It can be hard when you're blindsided like that. You're so unprepared to even think of what to do. I know in my past relationships that I was cheated on I always wanted to work it out because I wanted them to choose me. I wanted to be the one that ""won"". That never really worked out for me. I've learned for myself that cheating is something I can never get over. Even though continuing the relationship felt good at the time, that doubt was always in the back of my mind.   Do keep in mind though, your partner cheating on you is not a reflection of you. It is a reflection of them. ||| This is definitely sudden for u. For now what u need is time to calm down before u make any decision. Ask urself why do u still want to be with him after he cheated? Was it a one side thing that u still love him, that's why? Even though, he is well aware what he did and decide to do it anyway? I got micro cheated from my ex before, during our relationship, I always got several opportunity to meet girls, talk to girls, and even some show signs of liking me. Before getting into relationship, I even liked another girl but never got the chance to approach until I entered a relationship. When given the with chances, what did I do? I passed. I have standards, I understood that I made a choice to be with someone and know that I won't want the other to cheat to me.   Do u believe he will be improve and learn? Or whether this will repeat? Don't ask 'love him' self, ask the version of urself before u met him. What would she think? Would she have say go for it? If everything still come out as wanting to be with him, then go ahead, but remember this will be a scar that remain an insecurity throughout ur entire relationship. Whether ur friends or family or anyone know it or not, it will not be the same again. Choose wisely."
"Got back together with an avoidant, dumped again a month later","All my friends and family told me not to get back with her if she asked, should have taken their advice lol.

Fell for the oldest trick in the book. We split up about a month ago, with the textbook avoidant style. I didn't even know anything about attachment theory before coming to this sub, but it all makes so much more sense now. The early rush, love bombing, making you feel anxious by flipping a switch to randomly go cold and distant (while acting as if they're doing nothing wrong and you're the crazy one).

We got back together literally the next day when exchanging things; we both agreed we didn't want to lose each other and we could make it work - because we worked so well together. We promised each other that we would TALK and address any issues we had head-on so we wouldn't be in this situation again.

What an idiot I was to believe that, right?

Because here I am, one month later, and the exact same thing has happened again. Went cold due to some bad family news, claimed I wasn't there emotionally for her (I was literally checking up on her constantly, asking if she was okay) and saying that she felt she was pulling both our emotional weights because I was calling her out on her coldness. 

I don't get avoidants. I can't tell what would be worse - if they are aware of their behaviour, or if they have zero idea what they're actually doing to people. The people they're supposed to care about the most.

Just a few days ago on Thursday night she was telling me how happy she was and how glad she was we worked things out, planning future trips etc etc. Then 24 hours later going distant and cold again. As soon as it happened, I could see the writing on the wall and knew what was coming as it exactly matched what happened last time.

Oh, and you know the real kicker? Yesterday when we broke up, we had a phone call that morning where I confessed my anxieties and was vulnerable with her - she assured me that we were fine and I had nothing to worry about. Then broke up with me that evening. (via text, i might add! How noble.)

What drives these people to do this? She really is just textbook avoidant, matches all the stories i've been reading here lately. We never really had any arguments, which makes more sense now - at the time I saw it as a good thing, but no, turns out she'd been bottling up all that resentment this entire time and it all came out at once (despite her constantly reinforcing we needed to talk about problems in a healthy relationship!!)

DO NOT make my mistake, DONT get back together with an avoidant. Not unless they specifically state they are aware of their issues and are working to fix them with therapy etc. Even then, i would be sceptical. 


My love genuinely goes out to all those suffering from heartbreak from an avoidant. They *absolutely* exist and they will give you the worst, most blindsiding emotional pain you can go through.

Why do they try coming back?,"After months and months of making him cared for, looking out for him, and giving my all in our relationship, we had one disagreement and he confessed that he didn’t love me the same way that I loved him.

I finally explained my feelings and he still didn’t know what to say but a half ass “I’m sorry”. I blocked him after that. He’s still trying to contact me now. 

Why do they continuously poke and bother you when THEY left? When they walked out when it got hard? After so many tears. So many nights feeling hopeless or hopeful that it could come back.

There's no medicine sadly. Only time will cure it.

I still have those traumas sadly but I don't often dream about her often. I still sometimes dream about her but it's not really severe and I still cope with that.

Sometimes it is seeing her in public and having a weird, awkward conversation. Sometimes it is finding out she is in a new relationship. Sometimes it is flirting with each other again like we did 4 years ago.

Blindsided by my girlfriend breaking up with me immediately as we got home after a camping trip — I don’t know how to move forward,"Hi everyone,
I’m really struggling and could use some support or perspective.

I (30M) was just broken up with by my girlfriend (24F), and I feel completely blindsided. We had just gone on a camping trip this weekend with her friends. While I felt some emotional distance at times, we still shared meals, talked, kissed, and told each other we loved one another. I truly thought we were okay — or at least that if something was wrong, we could talk about it. But shortly after we got home, she ended the relationship.

She mentioned some concerns — mostly about finances and some emotional misalignments — but none of it was ever clearly brought up as a serious issue during the relationship. In fact, just two weeks ago, she wrote in my birthday card how she had seen my growth, how proud she was of me, and that she “wasn’t going anywhere.”

Since we met, I’ve been actively working on myself: paying off debt, going to therapy, learning better communication, and trying to build a future not just for me, but for us. I know I’m not perfect, but I’ve been truly trying to grow — for both of us.

I sent her a heartfelt message after the breakup — not begging, just sharing honestly how much I love her, how much I want to work through things, and how shocked I was. I haven’t heard anything back yet, and the silence is unbearable.

I feel completely shattered. This isn’t just a breakup — it feels like losing the future I thought we were building. I don’t even know how to sit with this pain.

Has anyone been in a similar situation — where you didn’t see it coming, and you felt you weren’t given a chance to work things out?
Is there any way to come back from something like this? Or how do you begin to let go of someone when you still believe they’re the love of your life?

Any support, advice, or shared experience would mean a lot right now.

TL;DR:
My 24F girlfriend suddenly broke up with me (30M) right after a weekend trip together. I thought things were fine — she even told me two weeks ago that she wasn’t going anywhere.

"He Made Me Believe in Love, Then Faded Like It Meant Nothing","
I never regret anything in life, but this time, I do. I met a guy who made me believe he was different a gentleman. He noticed even the smallest things, like if I stayed silent for two minutes, he’d immediately ask, “Oh baby, what happened? Why are you upset? I care for you.” He’d say he loved me, and that he genuinely wanted to know how I felt. Deep down, I kept denying the truth that no one falls in love this quickly, that maybe it was a trap, and he might disappear one day like Amod or someone else. But he made me believe. He convinced me that he was real, that he was sincere, that he meant what he said. And the moment I let my walls down and fell for him… he vanished. Slowly at first fewer calls, just once in four days, then disappearing for two days straight. No explanations, no concern. I kept wondering why. Why did someone who cared so much suddenly not care at all? How can someone pretend to love so deeply, then just go cold? Maybe I wasn't wrong for believing maybe he was wrong for making me believe.

I Broke No Contact No and she eventually said she’s “I’m not ready to talk like we’re friends (my name)”,"My ex and I broke up about a two months ago. We text for a couple days a little bit at the break up and it ended with my expressing wanting to come see her, but she said no she needed to time to heal. We both missed each other that this point. So we didn’t talk till my birthday came around and I’m in a new city with new people so I spent my birthday alone. I ended up texting her keeping it opened for her to not engage. She engaged said she was thinking about me too me to on my birthday. There where a few light messages back an forth and I get a little too heavy in my negative thoughts about my new place and she disengaged for a day. And I was driving my self mad and send a more loaded text asking if she could set time aside and talk when she more free, still with an out. She responded two days later saying “I don’t think I’m ready to talk like we’re friends (my name).” I told her I understand and will give her more space and I’m here if she wants to talk now. 

And I know at this point I have to give her space and work through my pain, focus on what’s in front of me. I’ve been cutting some weight going from over weight to in shape, and learn to enjoy my internship. But I still want to reconnect with her still. 

So I ask y’all tell me I’m an idiot. I do still want to reach out after giving her space assuming she doesn’t how should I approach it. 

The break up was mutual lead by me, long distance took its toll on us. And we expressed keeping the door open at the time. But I know things change.

Hey R, whatever happened between us... its still fresh, but its also in the past now. I said once that I didnt need you, that I wanted you. But what I failed to realize is that wanting someone with your entire heart sometimes feels a lot like needing them. 

The truth is, even now there are parts of my heart that still belong to you. I know you may not want me in your life anymore, and I respect that. But I still think about you. I hope you're doing well, staying safe, and that your phillies pull through this year.

Every night I pray for your peace and protection, and every day I wonder how you're really doing. Especially beyond the silence. 

I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything, and as weird as it may sound, I believe what happened between us happened for a reason. I've grown because of it. But if im honest, I still wish we could've grown together. I wish you were walking beside me now, not behind in memory, not ahead in hope, just with me. Here. Now.

Sometimes I catch myself trying to make deals with God. I tell Him that if I could just have another chance. I'd do right by you in every way. I'd reflect my love more clearly, maybe even help you rediscover faith through it. I don't know if He listens that way, but I keep asking anyway.

So here I am, continuing forward. Not stuck in the past, but carrying it with me. If there's ever a moment you feel like talking again. I'll be here, no pressure, no expectations. Just someone who still cares deeply and is silently rooting for you in every aspect of life. 

Take care of your heart, its the most beautiful thing about you.

"It's been a year, but I still miss you.","It's been over a year and I'm still looking at my phone wondering if I'll ever get a message ""how are you"" or ""I'm thinking of you."" You return my messages if I write them, but they are always short, and you never ask how I'm doing or try to keep the conversation going. It's clear it's one sided. Like you are wondering: how is it possible she still has feelings for me? Even though I loved you for over a year and you said you did too. It's like you took your feelings, and all those thoughts of loving me, wrapped them up in a box with a bow and shoved it into the back of your closet and haven't thought about them since.  You respond, but only because you feel guilty to not respond. 

You've moved on, to another city and country with a nice, new, shiny life. Meanwhile, I'm unemployed here following my professional setbacks, and AM having trouble moving on because my life is a mess. And I miss you. I think about calling you to tell you I'd give it all up and move to be with you, but am worried if I ever did that when I get there I'd feel even more alone. I'd still be chasing you even when I'm with you. And if I needed your help translating or help settling into the country, you would just get annoyed at me. And then I'd be in another country, alone, thinking how I spent more time investing in this relationship and how I should have tried finding someone while I still had the chance to have kids. 

It just feels like a lose, lose no matter what I do. I think about calling you, but then hold back. But in the end it doesn't even matter, does it? For all I know you are happily in another relationship. Already moved on. So it's all just emotional/mental gymnastic isn't it?

How do you find closure when things ended on bad terms?,We’ve been no contact for a few weeks now and I feel this overwhelming urge to write him a letter basically saying goodbye the right way. We ended things very nastily and it’s hurting me a lot knowing that. This was someone I spent half a decade with whom I share a lot of beautiful memories with. I feel like our relationship meant so much more than how things ended. I know there’s no use in ever reaching out again but please convince me not to. I know he’s not thinking the same way I am. I know he’s not thinking about me at all and will just carry on with his life like I was never apart of it. ,2,3,2025-06-29 23:25:20,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnsq9q/how_do_you_find_closure_when_things_ended_on_bad/,,,"Write the letter. Then don't send it. Then read it again 2 weeks later. But still don't send it. ||| Its been 9 months for me, 3 of full no contact (another 3 before that, we only spoke cause she owed me 1k lol :/ ) That was and will be the last time we spoke unless she reaches out. She broke up with me, even though she did way more damage than I did... And even after that I still tried to talk to her, I still changed some things and stretched the metaphorical rope beyond what I thought was possible to compromise.  I asked her if she wanted to end things on a better note that wasnt her basically ""back stabbing me"" with a blindsided discard. Despite the fact that 3 months after said discard I tried to talk to her about it like adults... she wasnt having none of it... 0 Accountability, after I of course apologized for my parts, she didn't care, it was just excuses on why we couldnt work out now... So figures that 6 months later her reponse wasn't much different. Except I came a lot more prepared for the discussion and she could no longer deny she had been a really bad girlfriend... Still she chose pride... didn't admit to any of it, she simply deflected or defended, but like I said since I had more preparation, Im very certain we both know and noticed what she was doing...  Anyway even after all that fantastic behaviour of hers, because I still loved her, I gave the benefit of the doubt, I told her lets just leave our differences aside and say goodbye properly... Hmmmm no... Still too much work for her I guess... So i just wrote her my goodbye letter, along with another i had written a few months prior and hadn't sent yet. And sent them, with nothing in return.  All of this to tell you, IMO you should do what makes you feel best at this point... Cause they most likely could give less of a shit... Especially if he broke up with you   Just know that if its been 7 months... You will continue delaying your healing further, by causing another recent interaction with your ex partner. ||| Sometimes you don't get closure and that's okay. If things ended badly, a conversation afterwards probably wouldn't have gone any better. Maybe this is protecting you from further hurt.   I had that ""closure"" conversation after a bit of a messy break and it ended with me just sitting there accepting and apologising for all these horrible things that were hurled at me. I shut down and then later had to unpack it all, angry that I didn't stand up for myself."
What do I do when my ex’s family still likes me?,"Basic background of this is that me (M23) and my ex (F21) dated for nearly two years and  we were talking about marriage  either during or after I graduated law school which would be about 3 years. Around my birthday I started to noticed that she seemed checked out of our relationship and she admitted that the butterflies were gone along with asking me to stop talking about marriage. Her primary concern was that physical distance was getting harder for her to deal with. I got blindsided by that and she told me that she didn’t really have a reason to break up with me but that it was something going on with her. I could see that I was getting strung along a bit and a few days after my birthday I sat down with her and asked her she thought breaking up was the best for her to do. She admitted yes and that she was told it was the best thing to do by several of our friends and her family. I was pretty heartbroken over it but walked away and kept no contact and it’s been that way the past few months. Anyway certain things have just felt weird with her family members still talking to me. Her mother was very sad about us breaking up and told me to keep in contact, her sister as well told me that she didn’t want to lose having me as a friend and even the grandma didn’t know about us breaking up until a few months after.

The fam had a hard time letting go of the idea of her and accepting me and ended up loosing all of us so… Just some food for thought ||| Number one bro, don’t be the one to reach out to her family — if you do, she’ll see you as weak and someone who can’t handle the breakup. If you run into them somewhere, smile, be polite, have a light conversation if they start it, but don’t go looking for contact. Most importantly, have no contact with her. Focus on yourself, train, dress well, level up mentally, and stay committed to ghosting. Add a few proven strategies on top of that, and I promise — sooner or later, you’ll get that unexpected message from your ex."

So I hung out with my ex today for the first time in a year.,"Me (19F) and my ex (19M) broke up around a year ago, and things did not end well whatsoever.   I won’t get into all the details, but it really hurt me deep down at the time. We were not on good terms AT ALL. I was extremely heartbroken for a while.

I was debating on whether if I should contact him and apologize for my own wrong doings, that way we can at least be on good terms and I can fully put everything in my past. So this morning I sent him a long message basically apologizing for my wrongs, that I’m grateful for him because I wouldn’t be where I am today without him, and that I wished him all the best. Ending the message saying I don’t expect a response for him whatever, and that I respect whatever situation he’s in. 

He responds, we basically just start chatting about random shit for the day. He invites me to hang out with him so we can catch up. I go because why not. I have no intentions of rekindling the relationship, as we had broken up before and it’s just likely to happen again. I just respect him as a person and I want to have a friendly relationship with him. 

We hung out at the skatepark, I skated around a bit, we talked and joked around, texted after. However I don’t know if it’s just my ego tripping out or not, but he was being slightly flirty towards me, like trying to get me to sit beside him a lot, glancing and smiling at me.

Which on top of that I’m pretty sure he has a girlfriend… because he told me not to let anyone know about us hanging out, so I was like hm that’s odd, but okay. I guess he hasn’t changed lol. But I’m happy that we can be friends after all the bullshit that happened. I’ve made sure to set my boundaries with him, and I’ve been nothing but friendly.

It’s weird though. At the time of the breakup I thought we could never be friends. I absolutely HATED him for a long time. But honestly I’m at peace with it. I wouldn’t say I’m attracted to him anymore, but I still do have love for him, I missed him a lot as a person. He was my first love after all, it’s a funny feeling. Almost like a full circle moment.

I decided to look past it since we weren’t official at the time it happened but she ended up doing it again days after she broke up with me. I get it isn’t really considered cheating since both times she did it, we weren’t in a relationship but still it just hurts knowing that I was right the whole time. I was right in worrying about the other guy.

She was the one that ended things, told me she had lost feelings etc. but why is it that I still want her back even after everything she did?

The worst part of my breakup wasn’t losing them. It was losing myself in the process,"I stayed too long. I made excuses. I tried to fix it. And when it ended, I was left with a version of myself I barely recognized. The worst part wasn’t the silence — it was the way I forgot my own worth.

That pain pushed me to start healing for real. I ended up creating something called The Real Love Manual based on all the lessons I had to learn the hard way. If you’re still in that messy middle space between letting go and moving on, this might speak to you.

It helped me stop romanticizing pain and start choosing peace. That’s where the healing actually begins.

Not over him,"To make this as quick as possible, I go to a boarding school. There’s a 6 hour time difference between me and my ex boyfriend. We were together for 6 months (over the summer) and I broke up with him in November. I still liked him but knew that long distance was not possible for me or him.

After we broke up, we did not speak for a bit until I came home for christmas break. During christmas break, we met up. We remained friends.

He texted me, everyday. We had the double pink heart on snapchat. My mom still asked about him. We hung out when I was back from school. I dated other guys, yet never knew how to tell him as it never came up. Idk if he dated girls.

It wasn’t fair. I had not wanted to keep in contact with him as it made the whole process difficult. Yet I knew he wasn’t in the right mental state so I simply replied. I cannot tell what we were. I think at one point, we were friends then the line started to become blurred.

Two weeks ago, I just had enough. I had stopped dating other people a few months ago as I realized that there was no way I’d be over him. I was drunk and texted him “I miss you.” He responded that he missed me too. Then, he asked if I was being serious and that I should not say things as that could hurt people. I told him that I missed him purely as a friend and nothing more (complete bull) and said that I would completely understand if he did not want to talk to me anymore. He said yeah, he probably wouldn’t talk to me anymore. Then, a day or two later he unadds / unfollows me on everything.

I don’t know. I probably have no right to feel upset. A part of me is deeply enraged, though. Maybe I misread signals and believed there was something more to our relationship. I just feel hurt. I feel so incredibly destroyed. I guess it really hit me that I lost someone that meant the world to me.

Sorry if this doesn’t make sense, I’m too tired.

How do you move on when it was perfect and you ruined everything?,"As stated above, I (20M) was going out with my ex (20F) and I’m struggling. 

I’ve been through breakups before, and yes, they’re hard but the way I feel today after everything is nothing like I’ve felt before. She was genuinely perfect, and she was incredible. I don’t mean that she was just insanely beautiful but just the sweetest person ever.

She would do the most unreal things for me. For my birthday, she spent hundreds of dollars and went into debt to make it special for me - with her being a broke college student, I can’t even begin to imagine how much she would’ve suffered silently for doing that for me.

Furthermore, she would write me the sweetest letters, make drawings for me, build me things. I’m obsessed with Pedro Pascal and she literally played all of The Last of Us so that when S2 came out earlier this year, she could comfort me during the golf scene. She was just unreal and gave me nothing but love.

I screwed it all up tho, I was egotistical and a jerk. She gave me so many chances to change, and while I was improving, she said she didn’t deserve to sit through that pain and constantly have herself get hurt while it slowly gets better. I begged for her to stay, promising everything I didn’t do before - the effort I didn’t put in, being more respectful - literally the bare minimum was all she was asking for and I couldn’t give it to her.

She didn’t want to break up with you, but she had to because she wasn’t getting her emotional needs met and this is a very common thing with relationships.    Most of us never realize what you have until it’s gone, and that makes the pain so much worse. The good news is that she’s not the only one who can make you feel loved like that. The bad news is it’s going to take a long time to heal and get to a better place. It’s going to require real work on your rent to make sure you don’t hurt anyone else like that again.  I’m not sure how the break up happened and if you already did your begging and pleading, but it might not hurt to write a letter to express accountability and regret for your actions. This isn’t so you can get her back or feel better or forgive yourself. It’s so she knows she wasn’t crazy and she was justified to have her doubts and leave you."

Yes, I mean chemical withdrawals you are getting from the nerotransmitter Oxytocin. It’s not as intense as drug withdrawals, but whenever you were with your ex, certain stimuli associated with them would trigger Oxycotin alongside dopamine and other neurotransmitters, which is the responsible for bonding and those good cozy feelings people get with their partners.   After a abrupt removal of the stimulus (ex), your body is quite literally craving the neurotransmitter. That is why so many people (me included) get hit with almost like waves of grief. One moment you’re feeling sort of ok, and then suddenly you just get sad. This feeling still can occur, especially if a stimulus (sometimes unconscious) may have triggered a pathway in your brain that used to be associated with them and would originally release oxytocin.   Just push through it. Don’t let a chemical wave of sadness drag you down into the thoughts you worked so hard to overcome. It is 100% chemical and will pass! ||| Girl, I read your post about WHY he broke up with you.   You seem to have been continually obsessing about him and your breakup for the past six months.

Asking for opinions on my situation.,"Long story short my ex left me for various reasons after 2.5 years, all fixable issues in my opinion, but ultimately framed it as her needing to heal and grow individually from past trauma. I fought and pleaded for her to give us a chance, but ultimately she decided to leave and move out of our apt. As you all can relate, I was devastated. Panic attacks every morning for a month straight. 2 weeks after the break up, we met for 'closure dinner' and she basically said she still loves me and only wants to be with me, but needs this time apart. This was the beginning of me being strung along, and I happily went with it, with hopes of getting back together. 

A few months go by, I decide to end this push/pull dynamic after she proposed a phased out plan to 'maybe' get back together. This made me feel like a fallback, and she admitted she strung me along due to her indecision and fear of fully letting me go. This felt like a second break up. I started going on dates/hooking up, and were mostly good experiences but I realized I wasn't ready, and I was really just distracting myself from healing.

About another month goes by, and we had tickets to this concert purchased from a while back, and decided to still go (bad idea). It was a wonderful night and she ended up staying the night at my place. It felt like we were still a couple that night, sparks were definitely reignited. However, we were both still in agreement that we should stay broken up. A few weeks later, we meet up again to giver her the rest of her stuff she left at the apartment. She tells me she is ready to get back together and work on our relationship together. I tell her she is confusing, and that I'm frustrated that I put in the effort to get in the mindset of accepting a future without her, and was just generally shocked. So I told her I needed to process this and get back to her the next day. 

The next day she asks if I was with other girls, and I said yes and told her about the dates. She was really upset, and I felt pretty bad even though I know I didn't cheat or betray her. She was torn between her logical mind agreeing that I was allowed to do whatever I wanted since we were broken up, but she was destroyed from an emotional perspective. I totally get it, because if the positions flipped, I'd feel the same way. I'm not sure how to feel, but I do feel terribly about the situation and just want to at least end on good terms.",1,0,2025-06-30 02:42:19,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnwlrp/asking_for_opinions_on_my_situation/,,,

💔 I feel like a stupid fool - and I’m still not over him completely,"He pursued me and finally got me.  3 weeks into our meeting he gave me a “promise ring” and said he was gonna marry me.  I laughed and said no sir.  We were together for 3 years.  

I was his biggest supporter.  He got full time full custody of his kids about 2 weeks into us being together so I stepped up and I did everything for him (and his 2 little girls) I enrolled kids in school because he didn’t know how, made appts for him and the girls. Took the girls to their appts, I went to school functions when he couldn’t make it because of work, moved in with him for a month so his daughter could attend summer school because she needed a ride home (I work from home) and he was working his new job so he couldn’t take time off, I taught the girls things like cooking for themselves and responsibilities around the house so their dad wouldn’t have to do everything because he was so exhausted when he got home, the month I stayed there I made sure to have dinner for him when he got home, cleaned , did laundry, homework etc, taught the girls about consequences for getting bad grades and hanging around with the wrong people, I helped him financially when he didn’t have a job I helped him get the best job he’s EVER had (I applied for it without him knowing because I had faith in his abilities) I put up with 3 ex wives who didn’t know their place AND HE DIDN’T EITHER, his disrespectful cousin who was rude to me every chance she got and he never said anything to her, his even more disrespectful grown ass married daughter with 3 kids - she has daddy issues and “wanted him back with her mom” WHICH SHE SAID TO MY FACE and he again said nothing, I put up with him going to his ex wife’s house for birthday parties for the grandkids that I wasn’t invited to attend, his drinking problem his dismissiveness, his lack of empathy and I did all of this because he was abused as a a child by his mother, and his ex’s cheated so I thought if I loved him enough he would love me and appreciate me.  I wanted him to know I loved him because he was amazing and he deserved to be loved.  

4 months before our wedding he GHOSTED me, then went on a smear campaign lying to his family about what actually happened.   One night in January He was being mean just really ugly and mean. and saying mean things so I threw a little cup from the taco truck of salsa in his direction which hit the wall and splashed on him. He became violent - not physically to me but he broke my belongings, called me really awful names and rushed up on me like he was gonna hit me,  threw my stuff all over the place was yelling and going crazy.  (All of this was caught on the inside ring camera by the way) I called the cops to de escalate the situation - HE DID NOT GO TO JAIL - and after that night he never spoke to me again.  (Our wedding was coming up in May) 

He refused to respond to my calls or messages and refused to allow me to speak the girls after 3 years of me raising them.  He demanded his family members that were still friendly to me stop talking to me.   And he started sleeping with a new girl about a month later 

It was at that moment I wondered if I could actually die from a broken heart 💔 

It’s just been unbelievable.  Like a nightmare.  I’ll never understand truly why I didn’t matter enough to fight for us 🥺 To discard me so easily, our life together our future…it feels as if it was all fake.   Was I used? 

5 months later I still cry, I no longer lose sleep but I do wake up from time to time sad.  I think about him and the girls every single day and miss them so much. I find myself saying “oh he would love this” or “I should buy this for the girls” when that is no longer my life.  I see his car type everywhere when I never noticed it before, our favorite TV shows come on and I find myself picking up the phone to call him to tell him about Jasmine and Gino 😂 then I realize we no longer speak, I hear songs that I know he likes and sometimes I smile sometimes I cry, when I cook I get sad because we used to cook together,  those stupid tarot card readers keep popping up on my Tik Tok FYP telling me he’s coming back (don’t worry I know they’re fake but it does make me feel better 🤦🏽‍♀️) 

I have realized that what he did was not ok, I don’t deserve to be treated like that, no one does regardless of what I did.  I’ve also accepted the fact that just maybe the universe or the Lord himself removed him from my life because I refused to see all the red flags.  Either way I try my best to keep going.  I just really miss the man I met and the life we had in the beginning.  The hateful man at the end, I never want to see him again.

Always trust your gut,"Hi everyone,
I just need to let this out somewhere…

For months now, my gut has been telling me that my boyfriend wasn’t being honest with me. There were constant red flags..his behavior never matched his words, he would ignore me for hours or even days, mute my calls, disappear without explanation, even though I never pressured him. I’ve had so many conversations with him, hoping things would change, but it was always the same cycle. Yesterday, I finally caught him in a lie.
So last night, I packed up all his stuff and left it in front of his door. I’ve decided to cut all ties and never look back.

What makes this even harder is that he owns the gym I go to… my safe space, my routine, a place where I met wonderful people, join a community… and now I feel like I have to give that up too. I already sent the cancellation email, but honestly, this is going to be really tough.
Just needed a place to say it out loud. Thanks if you’ve read this.

Need advice for a confusing and complicated good term break up,"Desperate for advice.Sorry this is a bit all over the place.
My now ex boyfriend 25M ended it with me 19F 4/5 days ago. As much as it still hurts I completely understand why he made the decision. He needs to focus on himself, as do I, and that's ok.

We live together so not only have I had the thought of losing him on my mind but also my home. We've agreed distance is needed but he as reassured me all my belongings will be untouched for as long as I need until I have somewhere permanent to live.

The first two nights were awful, alot of inconsolable tears from me. (This break up brought up alot of emotions from traumatic experiences growing up). He was so patient with me through this and was as comforting and caring as he could be while keeping his distance. Night 3 he stayed the night at a friend's so we could both have some space which was very needed but when he came back the next day I couldn't take how distant he was being with me, which again I completely understand why but it still hurt. It felt like he was a hologram and every time I tried to touch him my hand just went through.

I figured I had to leave the flat which really I should've done on the first night but I couldn't bare leaving my safe space, my home in such an emotional state.

During those few days we made it clear to eachother we care and we love eachother (this was communicated healthily, not in a mindfucky kind of way). It's so bittersweet knowing this, it would almost be so much easier if we hated eachother but at the same time I'm so appreciative of the fact that we're good. Yes we're not in a relationship but I haven't fully lost him, he isn't necessarily going anywhere. I had a moment where I told him we couldn't be friends because it would hurt to much but not long after I said that we could be friends because he's too important to me and he agreed. He said this is the first time in a breakup where the other person hasn't hated him or he hasn't hated them loland the first time it's been on good terms which means alot to me.

We saw eachother today (after only leaving last night) since we had it planed anyway. We walked around the park in the area we grew up in and just talked. When we first met up we were both a bit awkward/hesitant on what to say but very quickly we were talking and joking like normal, I thought I'd have a negative emotional reaction to it but the whole thing was actually very reassuring and comforting. It was so nice to just be with him and to have some sense of normality. By the end it felt like he was trying to make it last a bit longer like taking us down a much longer route to leave the park when we already decided we were leaving through a quicker exit, then when we'd left the park he suggested walking a little bit of the bus route before getting on the bus (I know he doesn't like being alone, especially after the fact we've been by eachothers side nonstop for months). He walked me to my next bus stop and waved me off, as he did he looked so sad and it really hurt to see.

During one of our conversations we'd planned to see eachother in 3 days then decided it would be better to see eachother next week instead as to not push anything. We've also planed a day in the next week or so for me to go over and get ready for a night out then stay the night when my night out is finished since our flat is in the city so this would be more convenient but more importantly, it would be safer than me getting back to where I'm currently staying.
I'm very relieved we have some sort of plan/structure as to what's going to happen for now moving forward. 

I think in the first few days I got over the worst part of my negative emotions in regards to not being with him anymore but since I know we're ok at the moment I'm not as upset at the moment. I know this will take time to get over. Now more than anything im homesick. I want my bed and my space so much it's killing me. 

I'm not looking for reconciliation, I am however really hoping he can stay in my life because as I said, he is extremely important to me and I cannot fathom life with out him being present in some way. He's even said when time has passed I'm more than welcome to stay on the spare bed if I need somewhere to go.

My fear is as our connection is still strong this could all go wrong very easily. I understand limited contact, distance and boundaries are vital for this but Im worried about emotional slip ups from either of us. (Saying things we shouldn't in moments of weakness, that sort of thing). If you've been in the same or been in a similar position how did you get through it and where are you now as a result of that? How can I keep this positive and healthy for both sides?

Little details that might be important:
I have a feeling people might come for the age gap, there was no power imbalance and he treated me the best I've ever been treated by a man.

We established straight away no intimacy of any kind as that would be extremely harmful to the situation.

We're both AuDHD and share very similar difficulties growing up so mentally this has been taxing on both of us in ways that would be different for someone neurotypical or someone who had a stable upbringing.

The breakup was no ones fault, it happend over unhealthy coping mechanisms from both sides.

How do I feel the same peace they feel?,"Me and my ex gf were really really close to eachother and it got to the point of being very unhealthy and toxic. In the moment I knew it was bad but I kept going with it because I thought things would eventually work out. Fast forward like a month she decides she wants to breakup to work on herself. I could tell the signs were there and it felt inevitable. I lost myself pretty much because she gave me mixed signals at first then became very cold. I begged and begged and begged and begged for reasons why even though she wouldn’t tell me. I go to the hospital because I’m genuinely losing my mind and want to hurt myself. I come out feeling a lot better since I had met some really powerful people in there who really moved me with their stories.

Then I find out a couple more days later that she began dating someone 2 weeks after we broke up and messaging him only a couple days. She was very sad at first and seemed like genuinely destroyed then this random wave of relief hits her a week after the breakup? Is this real happiness she’s feeling?

Ex in a new relationship says she misses me,"I don't know why I'm writing this, I guess I need to vent a little 

Five years ago, I (M31)  met a girl (27) and we quickly became a couple. For three years, things were great: we communicated well, settled arguments quickly, shared the same passions and hobbies. It really felt like a perfect match.

Then life piled on. Money problems, immigration stress, mental-health issues, and COVID wore us down, and eventually, her feelings for me faded. We broke up calmly. I listened, accepted her decision, and we didn’t fight.

But we never truly separated. For a year, we kept sharing the same apartment (mostly for financial reasons), and after moving out we ended up as next-door neighbours. Aside from physical intimacy, we kept acting like a couple: emotional support, joint decisions, dinners, movies, even seeing friends together. Everyone thought we were still dating.

This year, In March, she met someone new. I assumed I was ready, I'd even downloaded Tinder, but seeing her with another guy hurt more than I expected. I was at my lowest and lost almost 20lbs. What didn't help was she kept telling me she felt guilty, that I was the best person she knew, and that if attraction were a choice, she’d choose me over him. Hearing that from her, and from our mutual friends who repeated it (because she was telling the same things to them), left me confused.

Her fling lasted only three weeks, yet it showed me we needed real distance. We agreed to back off but to stay in each other’s lives, promising not to date anyone from our close circle.

A month later, I matched with someone on Tinder and scheduled a date. Then I learned she’d started seeing one of my friends and coworkers. I felt deeply betrayed. I cut ties with her eight weeks ago and haven’t spoken to her since—except for brief work overlap on Fridays (yes we are coworker and have to work together for 1 to 2h every Friday).   
  
Fortunately, I’ve had a lot of support from friends and colleagues, even from her brother, who’s one of my best friends. He told me he doesn’t understand her decision and is shocked by her actions because he always thought I had a special place in his sister’s heart and believed we’d eventually get back together by the way she was speaking about me.

Two days ago, at work, she asked if I was still angry. I told her yes—that I’m nowhere near ready to forgive, and that even if I do someday, it won’t erase what happened. She said she misses me, misses talking and hanging out, but I reminded her that choices have consequences: she destroyed the bond we built over the last five years.

And that’s where things stand.

For the last 8 weeks, I’ve kept seeing the woman I met on Tinder, and it’s helped me feel better. She knows the whole story and accepts it because our relationship has an expiration date, her work visa ends in October, and she’ll have to return to her home country. What we have is somewhere between a girlfriend and a friends-with-benefits situation. I’m grateful for the comfort, but I’m also scared of what will happen when she leaves, worried about where my healing will be and afraid I might spiral down again.",5,2,2025-06-29 18:56:24,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnmhh2/ex_in_a_new_relationship_says_she_misses_me/,,,"I feel you brother.

She was my everything, but we ended breaking up in September. In the first couple of months we continued being intimate, until something changed in April. That's when she found a new boyfriend but has kept it low and blindsided me until I've seen them making out in public. She confessed that she still has feelings for me, she has even kissed my goodbye (basically cheated the new partner), but she thinks that he is a way better option for her and wants to proceed investing in that relationship. We are in no contact for 2 weeks now. The pain is just unbearable, I literally can feel my soul being ripped apart whenever I see her smiling in the office while looking at her phone."
"Why distance + stress breaks couples faster, even when they love each other (neuroscience breakdown)","Most breakups aren’t about love fading. They are about two nervous systems getting too overwhelmed to connect.

Here’s why long-distance + stress is such a brutal combo:

1. No sensory regulation
	•	No eye contact to soften messages
	•	No touch to calm the nervous system
	•	No micro-expressions or shared rituals
Our brains evolved to co-regulate in person. Texts can’t replace that.

2. Stress hijacks the brain
	•	Chronic stress (new jobs, life changes) overloads the prefrontal cortex (empathy, patience, big-picture thinking)
	•	The amygdala (threat detector) takes over
Small annoyances feel huge. Neutral messages feel cold.

3. Loss of connection rituals
Without shared meals, touch, or small daily moments, bonds lose the glue that keeps them alive.

4. The breakdown feels sudden
Because distance masks these signals, disconnection builds quietly for weeks or months until it feels like love “just ended.”

I’m trying to find myself again. ||| For me it was the fact that they were taking 5-6 hours of my day, every day. It was their evening and it was my mornings. I’ve tried to tell them that I needed time and space to get things done, for myself, but but they would get mad and cry because they thought I didn’t want to be with them etc   There was a lot to other things, but this is part of what made me sort of check out of the relationship while still in it. ||| Reading this makes a lot of sense ||| well written, and much needed thanks for the post ||| Went through the same thing. The communication went really bad at the end and saw signs that it was coming, but I ignored it. 2 year long distance, she was suppose move to Europe. She got very overwhelmed with family issues, father was very sick and other things. I couldn’t help or give her support from a distance unfortunately, in the end we were not very compatible due to culture differences. Still hurt a lot when she couldn’t give me what I wanted and she was my first love. ||| I mean I told her distance didn't mean anything as long as my heart was with her.. she said she wanted someone closer.. she broke.my heart..told me she loved me but wasn't in love. Told me she couldn't see marrying me. But all the sweet things she said.. idk how she could go so cold so quickly. It hurts so badly ||| Nah I dont believe. For me, if you really love someone, distance and the hard parts of a relationship (that ofc also happens in LDRs) wont be enough. You will fight. Thats what i believe. Lots of LDRs work and they meet each ither and marry in the future. I believe in love. ||| My relationship was healthy at first with some hiccups from my part due to triggers but we usually repaired misunderstandings when we met up. Then she went on a trip for a few months... I had a trigger and it started the downward spiral until the end. No way to repair anything, conflict became worse and worse. Had fights that wasn't expected at all.  There was no way to co-regulate or calm her (or even myself) down as usual and it ended.   I wasn't even acting like myself. I was completely out of wack that I became hyperaware of everything and my anxiety spiked due to the misunderstandings and a phase was seen as my ""true colors"". Everything that was manageable in-person became worse over LDR. ||| This is exactly what happened to me. It’s been 2.5 weeks and I’m still not sure how I’ll go on. He was my everything. ||| Mine did not recover and he moved on with someone who lived next door 😭"

I finally left after 5 years,"I feel stupid typing this. I’m just another brokenhearted soul, just another identical post in this sub. I never wanted to be here. I never thought I’d feel the kind of heartbreak I’ve seen on TV. I’ve seen it happen a thousand times to other people, but now that it’s happening to me it feels so new. I didn’t think I’d be like this, but I guess that’s what love can do to anyone. In a way, it could be seen as testament to how big my heart is and how much I love. 

This feels like there’s a hole in my heart. 5 years. I thought I would marry this man. He bought a ring and was going to propose. But he didn’t treat me right, and in response I didn’t treat him right either. Toxicity all around. 

I feel so empty and purposeless now. I get what people mean when they go through heartbreakand can’t eat or sleep. I feel like I don’t want to exist. I don’t know what to do with myself. 

Every time I was sad, I would go to him. Who do I turn to now? I’m so attached to him that even after everything, he’s the one I want to cry to. Like, I want to vent to him about the breakup as if he were a friend. He IS my friend. Can we even keep our friendship after this? I don’t want to lose him. 

I can’t cope with the idea that I’ll never touch him again or I’ll never be with him again. Will we ever share a laugh again? My heart feels panicked. Typing this made my heart drop like there’s a hole in it. 

I know this is for the best. We both agree. But we both wish things were different, that our attachment styles were compatible. But the changes we’d have to make to be together are too much. There’s still a part of me that thinks: maybe it can happen. But that’s my heart talking and not my brain.

All I really did was smoke weed before but the pain was too much. So I bought magic mushrooms, ate 3.5 grams for my first time and even that couldn’t destroy my ego nor escape her, I saw a lot of wild shit that I wouldn’t have handled before her and I would’ve been scared out of my mind, but even seeing my reality completely shattered right before my eyes.

Peace of mind letter,"We split up because he was unhappy with the time I've been obligated to spend with my children.  He had chosen to be minimally involved with my children/driving long distance to my home.  Our decision was to split up for a few months - for him to see if the grass is really greener being single.

Looking back, I see that I was doing the majority of the work to ease the time when I'm with my family.  There were other signs of him not committing.  I realize cognitively that things aren't going to work - but I have the daily struggle of not wanting to give up the endorphins of how his attention made me feel.  The right thing to do is to move on.

But I love him and care about him.  Background on him - childhood abandonment and neglect.

I wrote a letter.  Of what I want to give him after the few months have passed - partly in an attempt to help my brain stop obsessing.  Here is the letter:

I have empathy for your situation.  I really do.  What happened to you in your childhood, it hurts me in my heart, and it makes me cry.

You have had to learn to depend upon yourself.  You told me:  ""I've had to take care of myself, because no one else is going to do it for me.""

It has made you remarkably independent, but at the same time uncompromising.

I am the opposite.  I compromise myself in ways that aren't good for me, just so I'm not alone.  But I have to grow.  I am learning to not make compromises on what is good for me - on what makes me the person I want to be.

But there are healthy compromises and unhealthy ones.

I should never compromise on my dreams or values.

But relationships require healthy compromises.  Doing things outside your comfort zone.  Doing things you might not want to do.

You are one of the most amazing people I've ever met.  Your values, your passion.  It is what I fell in love with.

I don't want to give up on you.  You are a great person with a lot to offer.  But I have a lot to offer too.  I am willing to make compromises to make it work, but you have to meet me half-way.

It saddens me because I don't think you'll want to.  And I think you're missing out.

You have someone that loves you and wants to support you, help you and work with you.  But I don't think you want any of that.  And again, it's sad, because I think you're missing out.

Take things slow for the next few weeks and be very selective about people you talk with, places you may go and do your best to resist numbing out to the point of overdoing it (I numbed out with a LOT of alcohol).   Let yourself feel, express and release all those emotions. It's healthy. You're grieving - and that hurts.  In a week or so, see if you can make a list of past rough times you've gotten through, and you have to make the 'shit list' to read when you romanticize about them. It's very helpful to have that list on your phone.   Have the people who love you remind you of your amazing qualities. You'll need to remember their words when your mind plays tricks on you.   One of the best things to distract you is to learn to play a musical instrument. I know that sounds weird, but you absolutely can't focus on anything else when you're trying to play a new instrument.   Also, search for mental health game apps - at least if you're scrolling or playing, it can be something constructive.  Wishing you moments of peace on your journey. ||| Day 3 of brkup for me and the only thing is asking your frnds for help and crying it out.

"My ex wants me back, but Ive already moved on","She dumped me because ""I dont make her feel that way anymore"" after a few years of struggling with trust in the relationship.

Night out drama,"Wired update to my post from a few days ago of emailing my ex. 


I was on a night out for my birthday this weekend and a club happened to be closing near were I live, I thought that my ex/her family may be out the same night but I didn’t want to miss the closing party and it’s also my birthday so I’d like to celebrate and not let things stop me from living my life. 


I saw her family as I was waiting in the line, I did a good job in not looking at them and acting like I was talking to someone else when they walked past. It isn’t that I’m scared of the people it’s I don’t want the argument as they are very much loud people (you will find out more about that soon enough) I got into the club, this club has 2 stories so I said to my first let’s go upstairs first take it in one last time then he’d downstairs were the music we mostly listen to gets played. As I walk into the downstairs part of the club I see my ex literally the first person I see is her, from what I remember we don’t make eye contact but I do know she’s clocked that I’ve walked in. 


I turn to my friend say that she’s there and let’s go to the bar, we head to the bar is about a 20 minute wait. As I get to the actual bar I see out the corner of my eye that her sister is also at the bar on the other side, and I keep seeing her trying to get my attention, like I said I know this will be some loud drama shit so I’m ignoring it. A guy next to me then taps me and gets my attention for her, and she shouts “making money now are we”. 


Whilst I was in my relationship with my ex I happened to be homeless and jobless, and a month before my ex broke up with me I had just sorted out a job for myself and then a few months after she broke up with me I got a flat. So I’m just shocked that she is being so rude and I’m not sure if she’s trying to insult me as it hasn’t worked and instead made me just say “wow fair enough” and just look away and start dancing and laughing because me now having some success is so triggering to her that she will ruin her own night by triggering herself trying to trigger me. It could have also been because I had changed my profile picture and put as the caption “fuck bitches get money” I personally still think even if it’s the latter the action from her in that moment was wired and wrong, my ex and her had a clear conversation after the fact as well and it seemed a bit heated. 



I end up having a nice night dancing to songs talking about making money 👀😂 and loving every minute of it because it just feel poetic really. 


As I’m getting ready to leave my friend and I are leaving from the door we come in from and one of my ex’s new friends happens to be next to the door, she stops me and says “I know you” I say “I don’t know who you are what’s your name” in thr job I do I do meet a lot of people and it can be confusing who now knows me and who doesn’t. I did have a feeling she was a friend of my ex but wasn’t sure. She says I’m friends with my ex, I’m like okay I hope she is well, we then end up having a 30 minute conversation and I get her number as she wants to talk to me sober. She wasn’t nasty to me like her sister was the friend was quite kind and said that my ex hadn’t been saying nasty things about me but had said things like “he just wouldn’t change” when she broke up with me I literally said to her “I will change tell me how you need me to” and she had said “you shouldn’t change for people” this isn’t the only things she said when breaking up with me but this is already very long. 


I would never sit here and say I was perfect I have my issues and I am to the best of my abilities to make the right changes for myself still in know does it mean I’m not the “good guy” in this story I’m just one of the people in this story. 


From how the friend was talking to me it felt like my ex wants to try again but now with things like her family acting like that, it feels lost from her end but also. It just burnt me out as it was rude and completely uncalled for especially as I hadn’t said a word to them.

9 months out and not moving on,"We were together 5 years, broke up 9 months ago.  Technically, I was the dumper, although I felt I had no choice.  I made the decision, yet still feel like I was abandoned. Ex was giving me no hope that things could change enough for us to have a real life together. But here I am 9 months later and not moving on, missing ex every day, wondering if things might be different and we could make it work.  I’ve tried dating and other distractions, yet thoughts of ex always take over.  So now I am tempted to reach out but not sure I should. I don’t know if I can bear reopening the wound if nothing has changed, but am tortured not knowing if it might have.

Would you rather live with the “what if’s” by never reaching out ? Keep your peace and all the progress you’ve done so far ? Keep looking forward and keep trying to better yourself ?  2. Or would you rather live with the closure that you tried all you can ? Gave your everything, your 100%. At least you tried and that means you will not have regrets.   Now before making that choice, have some personal reflection. Have you grown since the breakup ? Enough to avoid previous mistakes ?   I really hope it’s gonna turn out fine for you.

I fucked up,"Basically broke up with my boyfriend because I was feeling confused. 3 months out I realize I was being psychologically abused by my dad and that I started to exhibit defensive and toxic behavior when I look back at it. I texted to apologize and told him and was good about catching it sometimes but in the end I was in full protective mode.  When I texted after our final fight I said sorry for my behavior I don’t except anything I just needed to own my part. Texted a month later asking to talk to explain it more then backed out last second because I got scared told him I was feeling a lot of grief and didn’t know if I could approach a conversation neutrally. I felt ashamed of how I chickened out and have been depressed ever since. He’s def moved on, unfollowed me, and I get why.
This back and forth, the constant confusion and uncertainty. I stopped going to therapy because my dad started to talk me out of things. Sad thing is that I tried my hardest to fight back this time. In the end I was no match for the emotional abuse and financial withdrawal. (He’s going to pay for my school)
Anyone have any words or insight that could help me. I loved him and he loved me but it ended rough.
Additionally note I’ve made plans to move out, the break up pushed me to the edge and actually got me to advocate for my needs, and really asses the influences in my life. I’ve cried hard but I’m really picky about who I let in, somewhat in a push people out but also like anyone who’s not curious or empathetic towards what I’m going through aren’t getting a response. 
It’s left me a little more lonely and I’m starting school in August so I know this is temporary. But I am struggling with my mental health I just need somewords of advice or anything,

Still wanting to be chosen,"I spent 2 years with a guy who never actually chose me. I chased for a year, then slowly broke for the next year, until my mental health got so bad I broke up with him.

He treated me horribly, for 2 years, and I know deep down it was the right decision to end things. I should have left after the first 3 months. Maybe then I wouldn't have to build back up my self-esteem. 

But yet I still have such a deeply ingrained part of me that wants him to finally choose me. To come back and realize how much harm he did and be the person I thought he could be.

It won't happen - I saw how much he fought for his ex before me and I'm pretty sure he still loves her. He never fought for me. 

I'm afraid he will just move on - and choose the next woman fully, the way I want to be chosen. And that will hurt even more.

I want to move on - but I can't.",3,0,2025-06-29 19:38:31,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnniba/still_wanting_to_be_chosen/,,2 year(s),
On and off again,"So my bf(22m) and I (23f) ended things last night. This time official. This will be our 3rd time breaking up in the last 4 months. He initiated 2, and I initiated 1. Just so weird. Never thought I would be the girl that’s in an on off relationship. 

Thankfully this is the end for good, but I can’t help but feel so much pain. I have no friends so it’s gonna be lonely. Don’t understand why he was this way. Anytime I brought anything up, it would turn into something much bigger with him threatening or saying we shouldn’t be together. Sometimes it was great and the next day he’d switch. He bought me a lot of gifts. 

I know I deserve someone that’s sure, but I guess I’m here to say, what was that? What was his issue? He’d always say he’d feel guilty and that I deserve better and said I deserve the world. But then our last conversation he said “I put up with you” shits confusing so sorry for the confusing post!

You didn't deserve it and I hope you find someone who treats you with respect.  Second....it's possible that this guy has an underlying mental illness, or some other issue (childhood trauma?) that triggers extreme reactions during arguments. Not that he should be excused, mind you."
I’m on the precipice of breaking up with him. Should I do it or not?,"I love him so much. I want nothing more in the world right now than for all our problems to just disappear and be with him, but the problems don’t disappear. I’ve felt disrespected in ways that I cannot tolerate and be okay with, and I’m sure I’ve crossed boundaries with him that he’ll never be okay with either, all because our communication is so so different, our thought processes are different, what we perceive as respectful and moral is different.

All my friends and family are tired of seeing me cry and be so depressed over feeling disrespected and gaslit and not treated well over certain things. But I love him so much. I want to be able to care for him forever no matter what but I cannot. I don’t have the strength in me to do that. And I want to be able to take care of myself too, and I cannot do the best I can at that when I’m in this relationship feeling like I am not able to trust him with my emotions, or drugs/alcohol, or to make me feel comfortable when we interact with my friends. But I have empathy for him. In every way he’s hurt me I see why he acted the way he did. And I love him. I wish I had endless love and strength to be with him forever but I just don’t. It feels like I’m finally admitting that I’m not strong enough and that feels bittersweet in a way— like I’m validating myself and acknowledging that I want to take care of myself first— while at the same time feeling like I’m giving up. I’m failing.

I know I’m not a perfect girlfriend either. But I just feel so unable to accept the disrespect and treatment I’ve had. I love him so so much. When I think about a future with him I feel fear, and this feeling like I’m trapped, but at the same time I can’t just accept a life without him in it. I can’t accept that it’s going to be like I’ve just killed him off from my life. He’s such a big part of me, of all of this. I love him.

You know that you need to do it, otherwise you wouldn't even be here asking Reddit. This relationship is destroying your ability to recognize what is best for you.

How to grieve a breakup :(,"I broke up with my partner of 2 years about 6 weeks ago and it seems like I'm stuck in the same feelings, thinking the same repetative thoughts:

\-All the things I could have done better to be there for her (regrets)

\-Ways she was there for me for the first year and a half and how good it was

\-Ways she pulled away in the last 6 months and trying to figure out why, or being angry that she did

\-Fantasies that she will come back ""healed"" and different, and ready to engage in a better way

I truly don't think it's a good idea to go back and try again, but I can't help wanting, craving, the parts of the relationship that did feel beautiful, safe, special and being afraid I won't find those again. Despite issues and incompatibilities these moments were extremely special to me and I can't help wanting them back.

Sometimes I let myself just express my emotions and cry, sometimes I review old messages and photos, sometimes I distrct myself. We have been no contact this whole time, due to her request.

I've never truly given myself space to process and grieve a breakup before, and I'm trying to do that so I can truly be past this before I start something new. But a lot of the ""processing"" and ""grieving"" feels more like obsessing about the relationship we had and being stuck in it.

On the other hand, if I just dive into distracting myself and moving forward, I worry that I will be just putting this pain aside and not truly process it. It's hard to figure out how much space to give this breakup.

I hear advice about ""moving on"" and removing all reminders of the relationship, but that also feels like avoidance and could come back later. I also hear advice about ""taking time to grieve"" but what does that mean? Should I be focusing on my feelings about the breakup, or trying to put it past me?

Please, people who have had healthy grieving processes, help! Especially if you were in queer relationships, but also if not.",3,1,2025-06-29 19:33:35,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnndzr/how_to_grieve_a_breakup/,,,"I think you need to find a good balance between letting yourself grieve and distracting yourself. Whenever I go through a breakup I let myself feel whatever I'm feeling. If I’m sad I let myself feel it, if I need to cry I let myself cry. I sometimes talk to a close friend about it or vent in my journal. The rest of the day I try to stay busy with work and hobbies. Every day gets a little easier."
lost my everything,"we broke up for the first time april 19th. it was out of nowhere. the day before i had asked him if we’d get married and he said it was very likely. the next day he came over and blindsided me. we met up 2 weeks later and i printed my journal that i had been writing in since he broke me. i let him read it all and he cried, and said he needed time to think. a month later we met up again the week of our 5 year anniversary. he let me talk and barely said anything, just cried. then he broke up with me again. he was holding my hand the whole time and calling me honey like he always did. we kissed one last time and it was a long slow kiss. that was the last time i saw him. this whole time he’s been saying he still loves me. his reasons were that we want different things in regards to raising children, where we want to live, and how many children we want. but in reality those things aren’t different he just doesn’t believe me when i tell him that. yesterday he removed my name from his insta bio so now it all feels so final. i feel like i have no more hope of reconciliation, i’m so heartbroken and he won’t reply to any of my texts. he has been telling all of his friends that he just doesn’t want me to change for him, but i haven’t been, i’ve been changing for me. i have said in the past that i wanted to stay in my hometown, that i wanted 1 kid, but i never really put any thought into any of it. now that i have my mind has changed he just doesn’t believe it. he asks his friends about me all the time but never reaches out. i guess i’m just confused, i don’t know how to fix it. i’ve never been so sure of love in my entire life, i know he’s it for me, but i feel like he wants me to just give up. he’s super avoidant if that helps understand him at all. and he’s not seeing anyone else he’s still in love with me. i’m a 23 y/o woman and he’s the same age but a man. i’m just so lost and i feel like i have no one.",1,0,2025-06-30 01:17:14,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnuze0/lost_my_everything/,,,
I [25F] am being asked for space by my boyfriend [25M] so he can decide if he still wants to be with me — how do I know if I should just walk away?,"I really need some outside perspective because I feel like I’m emotionally unraveling. I [25F] have been with my boyfriend [25M] since we were teenagers. We live together, share financial responsibilities, and have built years of memories — so leaving isn’t easy or simple.

Over the past few months, things have changed. He recently told me that he needs space to figure out if he still wants to be with me. But at the same time, he tells me:
	•	“I’m not breaking up with you.”
	•	“I just don’t want to lead you on.”
	•	“I’m still with you because I don’t want you to think I’m out there doing something shady.”

He says he wants to stay loyal and respectful — but he also says he can’t be around me, talk to me, or emotionally show up right now because it would be “leading me on.” Meanwhile, we still live together. He’ll flirt or joke around (like at the lake the other day), but then later tells me he didn’t mean to give mixed signals and doesn’t even remember saying things.

I’ve told him that this in-between space is incredibly painful for me. I told him it feels like we’re broken up even though we’re technically not. His most recent response was:

“I’m trying to decide if I’m gonna be with you or not. I don’t want to just break up and come back, so I’m taking a break. I still love you, but I don’t know if I want to be with you. I’m dealing with a lot and trying not to hurt you more.”

The worst part is — he’s also liking a lot of things on social media that feel very telling. Posts like:
	•	“Another man would love you better than I ever could.”
	•	“Learning to unlove someone you planned forever with.”
	•	“How to move on without closure.”
	•	And even things about asking other girls out or being a better boyfriend than their current one.

I haven’t confronted him about those likes, but they sting. It feels like he’s already halfway out the door emotionally while I’m still here holding on, hoping.

Every time I try to talk about how I feel, he says things like, “I just want to work and make money” or “I’m not trying to go there right now.” It feels like I’m being left behind silently while he “figures it out,” and it’s exhausting.

I’m trying to be respectful of the space he asked for, but I’m breaking down inside. I feel like I’m being kept around as an emotional backup, not a partner. And even though I still love him, I’m starting to wonder if staying is actually hurting me more than walking away would.

How do I know when it’s time to leave someone who isn’t sure about me? How do you walk away from someone you still love when staying feels like slow heartbreak?

Any advice, insight, or even shared experiences would really mean a lot.

Gf of 2 years ghosted me and is with her toxic ex. How to move on? Her family wants to keep me around.,"My ex and I started dating in 2022, and she had told me about a toxic ex she had that was long distance. And what she endured during that relationship was terrible. Her trauma was present throughout our relationship and I wanted to help her and love her. Throughout our relationship she would either reach out to her ex, or her ex would reached out to her, and they would talk. I decided to look past it because i loved her a lot. Fast forward to April 2025, she sends me a message saying she wanted to break up, that she has unresolved feelings, and that she moved on from her previous relationship quickly. (When we first started dating she said it had been a while since they broke up, then in april she said she got with me only days later.)  she left me confused. She wanted to stay in my life after because she said she didnt know if those feelings are valid or if shes making the right choice. Throughout April we would meet up everyday talk like we used and i started to get confused on why we broke up in the first place. I asked her about it and she said she still hasnt figured out her feelings and I rode it out. On May 1st I noticed she unfollowed me on IG and i searched her ex's ig and he had made a new acc with 1 follower and 1 following and it was her.

Throughout May she would say how much she loved me, and wanted me back. I wanted her to figure out everything so that we could have an uninterrupted relationship and one day out of nowhere she said we shouldnt talk anymore that she wants to explore something with her ex. She had told me she hated him, and would never get back with him. She told she followed him on IG to get closure and ask why he treated her so bad. And he didnt say sorry, but when i brought that up she responded with ""he ended up apologizing"" we went a few days no contact after she said ""I choose him"" may 31st i asked if we could go on a walk and she agreed, we walked around and she wouldnt stop hugging me wanting to hold my hand, kiss and we had a good talk, of where she was at and she said she wanted me but needed a little bit of time. Then she says shes going on a trip to a different state (where she was born) and after the walk i handed her a note as to why she shouldnt give a second chance, she kept saying she wanted to give a second chance and I wrote a heartfelt letter about it. And once i was home she said she wanted to be a little more honest and told me she was going to that state and get picked up at the airport by him, and be with him. I was torn.

We texted more about it. And she kept saying throughout this ""figuring out"" phase, that she was in too deep with her ex to break his heart. And im upset i healed her, and helped her become the best version of herself. We texted throughout the night because her flight was the next day in the morning. As we texted i asked why she wanted to go through with it and she said she doesnt want to keep thinking what ifs, or what couldve been. And i asked why she wouldnt and she said because it would hurt me and possibly a future. She told me she wished she chose me earlier because he had hurt her again before her trip and made her cry. I sent her more heartfelt messages and she replied with ""I choose you, i want you i do, just let me do this car ride, hang out whatever, and face him, ask all the questions, and yell at him. I understand you may not be comfortable but I want to do this."" I told her how i felt and that i Thought it wasnt a good idea. she said she wants me but wants everything to be okay. I sent her another essay, and said have a good flight. We went to sleep on the phone.

When i woke up I was blocked on everything. I sent her a imsg and she said ""i landed, we'll talk soon but I cant have any distractions"" and that was it. I asked her dad to go on a walk and told him, and he was confused, and angry at her. as june went on and i found out that she has been at her ex's house staying over at his house even when her parents told her not to. I started ""healing"" I would talk to her older sister for hours about everything, and her dad on occasion. Ive grown to be really close to them. And theyve been on my side mainly. I made the mistake of looking at her ex's tiktok, and there were posts of them together and her looking happy, and in love which set me back more. I got a last message from her which said ""im with my ex now, leave me and my family alone."" I told her her sister about it and she got pissed saying dont leave anyone alone. Her dad also said she brought me into their family, and she'll have to deal with the consequences of her actions. Her mom has also supported me.

I feel like i have been making close to no progress. I deleted her photos, blocked her on anything i didnt reply to her text. Her family is telling me to cut her off but do i cut them off too? theyve been really helpful etc, so i dont know what to do. They told me i deserve better, ill find my person, and that i dodged a bullet. But it seems like their wiping their hands on the situation i told them im concerned about the peace in their family i felt as though me being in their orbit would cause tension and all he said was ""Shell be alright, these are the consequences of her actions dont worry"" so im unsure of what to do at this point. Im mentally drained and want to shut off the world for a while. They want to come to my college graduation hang out with me etc, but i dont know how that affects me moving on. Possibly being the godfather of her sisters kid. I grew a bond with them, and i guess a tighter one since this happened. This caused a strain on her and her dads relationship, and her sisters. I just dont know what to do. I dont know how to properly heal, what my next course of action should be or what. Could use some advice or what you guys think about what happened to me.

Edit: Her family hates her new boyfriend and they have been pretty vocal about that, they said a narcissistic toxic person like him doesnt change. And him disrespecting not only my ex, but her family as well. ",1,0,2025-06-30 01:05:31,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnur3b/gf_of_2_years_ghosted_me_and_is_with_her_toxic_ex/,,,
I need help/advice I just broke up with my first girlfriend,I broke up with my first girlfriend last night we spent a year together and a year in a long distance relationship she recently moved back and ever since then it hasn’t been the same. The whole time we’ve been together she couldn’t ever communicate to me and she would just disappear for hours without telling me when we had scheduled to call or whatever I tried talking to her about it countless times and each time she said she’ll stop or she’s trying but it never improved or changed. All she ever wanted to do was go out with her friends to party’s and to drink and smoke and I couldn’t take it anymore she would never tell me who she was with or where she was going she would always just disappear and not communicate to me. There’s so much more things she did to me that was messed up but I don’t expect a lot of people to read all this and I just want some advice on how to get over all of it this is my first breakup I just need someone to talk to,1,0,2025-06-30 01:05:05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnuqt2/i_need_helpadvice_i_just_broke_up_with_my_first/,,,
Freshly broken up with,"(LONG DISTANCE) Got broken up with 3 days ago by my boyfriend of 1yr + 8months. He was an amazing guy. Long story short- I kept repeating something horrible whenever we’d get into an argument and I deeply regret it. We’d get into arguments where the other person would say something they don’t mean and yet……he decided to end things with me..I asked for another chance to prove myself but he refused.
(At first he said we could be friends and maybe potentially get together in the future but no promises) since I was so persistent to NOT break up and to resolve our issues— that’s when he denied being friends and said “No, there’s nothing now.”. I was happy the day after the break up, because I finally felt like I wasn’t tied down, nor stressed……

It wasn’t until a day ago I sent his mom a message stating we weren’t together but I still appreciate all what she’s done for me. Get this— she told me she didn’t care that we split up and that she’ll always be there for me and she’ll call txt and be there for me if I needed her. That sorta made me weird, due to the fact I kept thinking if he were to move on and I were to still be apart of her life— it’ll be weird for me……..plus she told me advice on how to let go of minor stuff in an argument and to give him space for now………….was going to ask for some input. Yes, I’ve been focusing on myself more and ACTUALLY doing the things I put off for a while!

Just a question. What should I do?",1,3,2025-06-30 00:55:02,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnujl7/freshly_broken_up_with/,,,I would ghost the ex-boyfriend but stay on friendly (but distant) terms with the mom.
He love bombed me & found someone new in 3 days.,"To start off I met a man 3 months ago. When we met he made me feel like I was the most important human ever. Showered me with attention, love, and everything I ever wanted. Always knew the right things to say. On the other hand he wanted to spend every second with me, and when I would tell him I had plans it was a fight, but he would always say he got upset because he just wanted to be with me.  If I didnt pick up the phone right away or answered his text I was cheating. He wanted to know my every second moves. He was jealous of my brother, and got upset when I told him I wouldnt sleep over because my brother had gotten all 4 wisdom teeth removed and I was going to take care of him during the weekend. He once told me he had prettier girls than me and then apologized, came to my house with flowers and gifts. Another red flag is he purposely try to get me pregnant. Well 10 days ago he got upset, because I took a plan B. Told me I was a liar that I never loved him and blocked me. I spent the last 8 days trying to contact him and crying.  Finally spoke to him and he told me he had met someone else and had slept with her already, and they had been spending every day together. That broke my heart. I cant stop crying and hating him. I have dated other man, and been in other relationships but this has been the most painful breakup. It feels like I cant breathe. I dont know what to do, I have 3 months of amazing memories, this man filled my head with ideas of a future, kids, family, told me he would do anything for me and in less than 2 weeks met someone else. It is crazy how 3 months felt so long. He embedded in my mind that he was my soulmate.

I also want to mention I did everything I could to make him happy, he wanted me every day at his apartment basically and I would spend from thursday to sunday or sunday to friday at his apartment. He also blamed me for bad things that happen to him, he said him not going to the gym a lot was my fault because I was lazy. One thing he holds against me is that he found a text from a male friend, where he asked If I would go to his birthday party, tbh knowing how jealous he was I just deleted it. and he went through my text found it on my deleted and basically for 2 months called me a cheater. I should have seen all the red flags his body count was 120. When I told him mine was 22 he told me it was impossible and that made me dirty as a female.

By the way he sent me a picture of the new girl and told she me was badder than I was, and better in every way.",4,4,2025-06-29 17:20:57,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnk5q2/he_love_bombed_me_found_someone_new_in_3_days/,,2 month(s),"I rarely use this term, but this is toxic. You dodged a missile the size of Utah. Seriously. ||| Hoe (playfully) is you involved with my ex! We broke up 3 months ago, said he found his person and that he had gotten her pregnant and had gone through an abortion recently with her too. I doubt the 120 body count but holy shit there's multiple of these dudes out there hell noooooo. ||| Alright. Stop right there.  That man didn’t love you. He controlled you. He manipulated you. He wrapped poison in sweet words, and you drank it because it looked like love. That ain’t your fault. But now that you see it for what it was, it is your responsibility to spit it out and walk away.  What he did wasn’t romance. It was abuse dressed up in charm. He love bombed you, isolated you, tried to knock you up to trap you, then discarded you when you stood your ground. And now he’s trying to stab you one more time by comparing you to the new girl. That’s not a man. That’s a weak little coward who gets off on hurting women.  You’re crying over a dream he sold you, not the reality of who he was. Mourn that if you need to, but don’t confuse it with love. Real love doesn’t punish you for taking care of your family. Real love doesn’t get jealous of your own brother. Real love doesn’t try to own you.  It hurts like hell now, yeah. But thank God he showed you who he really was early on. He didn’t break you. He revealed himself. You just loved someone who wasn’t real.  You don’t chase a man like that. You don’t argue with him. You cut him off and you reclaim your damn life.  Stand up. Block him. Heal. And next time you hear sweet words too fast, look past them and see what’s underneath.  You deserve a good man. Not a parasite."
How do I move past this? I don’t know what to do?,"Who am I going to text “good morning, honey” to and be met with “Good morning, beautiful”? Who’s going to call me first thing in the morning just to hear my voice? Who’s going to call me sweetheart, gorgeous, beautiful? Who am I going to come back to at the end of the day to tell everything to—every tiny thing? And whose day am I going to want to hear about just as much, down to the smallest detail?

Who’s going to give me forehead kisses? Who’s cute cute little nose am I going to rub mine against with the biggest smile on my face? Whose hazel eyes will I look into and see my whole world, my future? Whose dimples will I get to kiss? Whose cheeks will I smooch? Whose chest will I lay my head on while they tuck my hair behind my ear and say, “head up,” and “head down”? Whose heartbeat will I listen to and feel lucky to be alive at the same time as them?

Whose warm lips will I press mine against? Who am I going to say “mwah” to after silly pecks or before ending calls? Who’s going to press their bare skin against mine—something so simple, but so intimate and comforting? Who will I ever feel that safe and vulnerable with again? Who’s going to hold me close in the shower, wash my back? Whose back am I going to wash? Whose fluffy hair will I shampoo and experiment on?

Who’s going to love every part of me—even the parts I’ve always hated? Who’s going to kiss my tummy and tell me they love every part of me they kiss, knowing it’s my biggest insecurity—and make me believe it? Who am I going to trust with that level of closeness again?

Who am I going to intertwine myself with and make love to with meaning that deep? The thought of anyone else makes me feel sick. Who’s going to kiss me from head to toe? Who’s going to make me feel beautiful no matter what? Who’s going to be my safe place?

Who am I going to nap with and sleep better than I ever have because I feel so calm and protected next to them? Who’s going to build Lego sets with me, watch movies drunk with me, roast Twilight with me? Whose laugh is going to make my heart flip? Whose smile is going to melt me?

Who’s going to tickle me? Who’s going to flinch when I reach for their armpit and spill the truth the second I threaten a tickle? Who will be my body pillow? Whose face will I know like my own—every freckle, every crease, every expression? Whose new beard styles will I get to see and feel? Whose upper lip and dimples are going to do that downed smile that reveals they’re lying every single time? 


Who will I explore the world with? Who will I grow with?? How am I supposed to go without seeing that smile? Hearing that voice that’s music to my ears? The most comforting sound I’ve ever known??

My niece (19F) thinks she might still be in love with her ex (18F) after a dramatic breakup… does she try to be friends again?,"Hey Reddit,
I’m writing this on behalf of my niece J (19F) who asked me for advice and also kinda wanted this story out there. She wrote the whole thing for me because she wasn’t sure what to do anymore. So here we go.

At the end of 2023, J moved across the country and started riding at a new horse stable. Within a month, she met her now best friend L. Through L, she met a girl named T (18F). J and T became fast friends, hanging out at the stables and outside of it. J knew T had a girlfriend at the time and that she was also a lesbian, but nothing else happened back then.

Summer rolled around and things changed. They both leased horses and saw each other every single day, getting super close and eventually becoming best friends. That’s when J realized she was falling in love with T, but didn’t say anything because T still had a girlfriend and J wasn’t out yet.

Then over winter break, everything changed. T and her girlfriend didn’t talk at all during the two-week holiday, but J and T texted every day. T later told J she had also started falling for her during that time.

In January, T and her girlfriend broke up, but T wasn’t very heartbroken — she had already been considering it. J and T had already gotten super close, and started doing “rebellious” stuff like vaping together (J's idea). It kinda became their thing. They were both in deep.

In February, J came out to T and told her she liked her. T told her she liked her too. A few days later, they got into alcohol for the first time, stole some shots from T's parents, and then went to the forest with a full liter of vodka (bad idea alert 🚨). They played a drinking game, kissed a couple times, but then J hit her head and blacked out from a combo of concussion and alcohol.

T had to call her mom, and they ended up calling an ambulance because J's heart literally stopped twice. It was terrifying. Luckily, J woke up the next day in the hospital and went home. Later that day, T met her at a playground near her house and they talked through everything — and J asked T to be her girlfriend. T said yes.

From there, it was a full-on first love experience. They texted constantly, kissed, told each other everything, said “I love you” after a week, celebrated Valentine’s and birthdays together, even went through all the bases (yes, all the bases 😳).

They were obsessed with each other — until pony camp.

At pony camp, everything went sideways. T started acting distant and weird. On the 4th day, they dyed their hair purple together, but J sent T a long message with all her worries (instead of saying it in person — she now regrets that).

The next day at the pool, they got into a fight about the message and all their insecurities came up. They “reset” the relationship and agreed to start fresh… but five minutes later, T broke up with J.

She just said, “I think it’s better if we break this off now.”
J said “okay,” and T walked away.

J had a panic attack, cried for the rest of camp, and told herself it was for the best — even though she definitely didn’t believe that.


Now — 3.5 Months Later
They didn’t speak for a long time, just a quick “hi” once. But recently, they had their first real convo since the breakup. It was short and casual, but it made J realize she might still be in love with T.

She doesn’t know what to do. She’d at least like to be friends again, maybe more, but she’s confused.

Here’s the tea:

T snaps her back instantly, with full-face selfies or kinda flirty pics

T still wears the necklace and bracelet J gave her

T looks at her a lot in their friend group

T shares some secrets with her, like they used to

But J’s best friends think she’s being delusional and told her to let it go


One of her friends even said they’ll ask T if she still likes J “because it looks like J still likes her.” J’s feeling hopeful but also confused and scared.


So Reddit, what do you think?
Should she try to talk to T about how she feels? Try to rebuild a friendship first? Or let it go and move on completely?

Any advice (especially from other queer teens or people who’ve been through intense first loves like this) would be super appreciated",0,0,2025-06-30 00:47:38,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnuegf/my_niece_19f_thinks_she_might_still_be_in_love/,,,
Told me he finds it difficult to be attracted to me,"My ""partner "" and I had a conversation two days ago, it was about the lack of being physically intimate with each other, to the point where he doesn't even kiss me anymore. 

I brought this up, as having less sex is one thing (3 times in six months ) but now no kissing or even hand holding. 

Asked him why, he said he finds it hard to be attractive to me since I have put on weight. This is the second time he has said this to me. He said it the first time at the start of the year and since then I have lost 2kg. 

He says hes not happy, and hes only going through the motions in the relationship and that he is after loosing himself in this relationship. 

I comforted him and validated him because I love him deeply, he of course does not the feel the same way anymore. 

Told me it might be good to leave the house for a week or two, it's his house, I'm currently in my mums. 

I never thought a person that I loved would say this to me and I thought my heart was complete safe with him. But here we are. Heartbroken 💔  

I dont even know what advice I'm looking for. I just want to put it out there ",2,1,2025-06-29 20:59:57,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnpg8x/told_me_he_finds_it_difficult_to_be_attracted_to/,,,I'm sorry that this happened to you.

"Kinda broken here, and not sure how to process or move forward.","First post ever on reddit...  
So Me a 34m, I have 3 children, 2 I'm guardian of starting 3 years ago, 11f, 15m, and my own 4f from a past relationship that the mother repeatedly cheated on me with (with a crackhead nonetheless). The ex and I broke up 2 years ago, after roughly 3 months I had rebuilt my confidence and decided to touch base with a woman I had met when I worked at a convenience store around 4 years ago. This woman I had honestly started to have feelings with back then and stepped away as even though my partner at the time wasn't faithful, I wanted to be for the sake of my child with her. 

Fast forward to the start of my relationship with this woman, it was amazing, I really thought she was the mythical ""Unicorn"" for lack of better wording. We took things slowly at first as I had insisted as I didn't want these children to feel abandoned by yet another woman in their lives. Over this time, as far as I knew we had a perfect relationship. She had partially moved in over a year ago and fully moved in earlier this year.   
Without getting into too much, my mother stayed at this house with us and was a constant issue. She moved out recently and we started looking into either buying this house off her properly or moving. 

I wasn't working at this time due to childcare, however I wasn't and am not a deadbeat, I did every chore, albeit the house has been in need of repairs which I wasn't able to complete at the time. Well, at first my mother was going to sell us the house at a reasonable price that we would have been able to get a loan for as it wouldn't be able to pass inspection. As time went on my mother kept changing the parameters, to the point that it wasn't feasible (no bank ever would agree to the loan, especially with the needed repairs"" and made us super uneasy. During this time, we figured we would get the house, so we spent $4000 on tools and materials so I can rebuild and remodel the whole house. Well with the fiancé 31f deciding she didn't want this house anymore period, that made the tools useless. We would need a 2nd income. No issue, however, I misrepresented myself horribly here. Roughly 2 months ago I decided to start looking into woodworking, and using the saw mill we had to make some side income, I knew this wouldn't be a full time income to support us, however I wanted to get it started and set up. After this, if we were lucky maybe it would bring in the income we needed to not only afford the housing but allow her to quit her job. She had started getting very depressed about her job and the stresses. 

Well, as we were financially stable for the time being, I asked her to let me work on this side business for two months, and I'll look for proper work around that time as well, So I'd have a main source of income and a side business. Again, my goal was to get her away from her job, and to support everyone. Well, due to how I misrepresented myself and how I explained the situation, she took from it that I didn't want to work at all, and that caused her to feel used. She expressed some things to me, but instead of venting to me about her frustrations or concerns, she vented to her single cousin 29f, and her single mother (who's been single for the better part of 20 years). So, she decided to leave one day, packed everything and left, treated me short and shallow, wouldn't let me explain myself, or try to work on the issues that miscommunication forced. 

I have terrible anxiety, and she asked for space, I tried to give it to her, and did a half way decent attempt. She decided today, (she left on the 18th) that she was finally willing to talk to me. And essentially told me she didn't want anything to do with me anymore and made up reasonings to elaborate on how bad I was. I don't get it, I was utterly committed to her, I believed her and trusted her when she said she would stay committed and wouldn't ever go anywhere. I had lost trust in women with my ex, and tried to hard to trust again, and ended up doing so. If she would have came to me and vented to me, I know deep down inside I would have fixed any problems... I truly loved this woman, and so did my children. I feel abandoned and thrown away. I feel like Love is not enough at all, that commitment just doesn't exist in this day and age as people will leave the second they have any issue. 

I would have changed the world for her if only she asked. Over the past 2 weeks I've spent 18-20 hours a day repairing this house (Completely remodeled, dry walled, and reframed the master bedroom). My mother conceded and admitted to the stress she caused and has given me the house and even offered to cover some bills for us so we can continue repairs. I've spent time learning that ""you're not listening to me"" is not meant to be a literal statement but a metaphorical one. That she wanted me to be a Dom, yet I never researched it properly and thought I knew, even though I had a hard time accepting that normal precepts that are ingrained in me as a man don't have a place in such a consenting field. I've spent hours each day listening to podcasts over the topic so I could live up to this. I've spent countless hours searching for jobs. Every issue she mentioned, I have gone above and beyond to show myself as willing to fix them and change, as I know I'm always learning and ever involving. 

  
I did everything for this woman, I'd make her favorite dinners, pack her lunches, make her coffee in the mornings, go to every family event. Anything she wanted to do I'd do, I showed her love in so damn many small and big ways, such as her having a particularly bad day at work, I bought her flowers, and made her favorite dinner, and then stayed by her side and tried to support her emotionally... 

 I'm kind of broken here; I've never loved a woman like I did this time. I didn't think true love was a thing till her, not even with my ex I have a child with. These children are broken; I'm lost. I had to have a friend come over last Tuesday and take my gun away from me as I wanted to leave, I couldn't accept being such a failure. I couldn't accept that I was the type of man to lose what I considered to be the best woman. I really don't know what to do here, I'm penniless with three children relying on me, they've been abandoned again. I have no support system; Xanax prescription is running out. Hell I'm crying like a baby while writing this, and I don't cry. I know I had issues, but I would and still sadly would fix everything for the sake of her and these kids. I just don't know if I'm even capable of taking care of them, or if they would be better off without me. Why is commitment not a thing anymore, and why are people so willing to leave a good situation when they lose feelings. Love is work, love is hard, and I was always told you stay committed, you only leave under toxic, or abusive situations. I was neither toxic nor was I abusive, I had plenty of issues that's for sure, but damn it I was a good man, and if there are god/s above, they know I loved her and would have worked through any issue. I sincerely don't know where to go from here, how to help these kids, or what to do anymore, she wouldn't even entertain the idea of us staying friendly so I can show her my commitment to change and her.

Would you ever get back with someone who emotionally cheated?,"I’ll keep this short, but I was the one who did it. I was talking to an ex and my girlfriend found out. It wasn’t sexual or romantic and it was one night over text. This isn’t an excuse but simply just context. It hurt my girlfriend to the point she never talked to me about it again and has had me completely blocked since. I regret what I did and I’m sure I’ll get attacked in the comments, but I am curious to know your guys thoughts. 

I have not attempted to reach out since an initial panic period from the day after. I’ve been in therapy weekly since and am doing everything I can do respect her space. I’m doubtful I’ll ever get the opportunity to speak to her again",1,12,2025-06-30 00:41:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnua68/would_you_ever_get_back_with_someone_who/,,,"Shouldn’t have been talking to her at all! You had a gf. ||| Well what did you talk about? I don’t think there’s any reason to be talking to an ex, if intentions weren’t bad I don’t think it’s worth ending a relationship over. If it was naughty stuff and emotional conversations or anything like that then I most likely wouldn’t go back. ||| Depends on the nature of the conversation. Ask yourself this: would you have said the same things to your ex if a friend or co-worker was with you?  If so.....then it's probably not ""emotional cheating"". But it still raises trust issues. People should be free to have platonic conversations with their exes, but it needs to be something that is established at the start of the relationship. ||| Block ||| I typically like to reverse the scenario and you can ask yourself, would you have been upset over what was said should that was your gf talking to her ex? ||| It’s a little confusing. Not sure what the nature of your conversations were. The biggest red flag I’m seeing here is the “my girlfriend found out”… Not that you told her, but obviously that wouldn’t be an easy conversation to have. Doesn’t really matter what the context was, it’s more the fact she found out you were communicating with your ex without her knowledge nor consent.   Sounds like there’s a lot of nuance here whether it was ignorance of betrayal or behavior you knew would upset her but you did it anyway. The fact that you’re at least understanding and not trying to deny how she feels is a good sign.  My ex emotionally cheated on me with her ex. I found about it and left for 4 days. We were living together and just moved across the country 6 months prior so there was a lot of emotions going on.   I did come back to her after she asked me to join her for therapy. We did one session and I buried my feelings and pain. We lasted another year and after we broke up that same ex came back into her circle.   That betrayal is a stain. It taints all good memories of what you had. Crazy thing is that I still have strong feelings for my ex 7 months post BU. I’m terrified to see her though because trust has been broken. There’s no way to know if your ex will come back. I’ve been physically cheated on and the emotional cheating that my ex did hurt worse. It took our 4 years together and inked the good memories. They’re no longer pure.   Respect her space, continue working on yourself and if the opportunity presents itself I recommend being completely transparent. If you haven’t I would probably cut all contact with that prior ex. Say your recent girlfriend gets curious and starts looking at your socials and such but still sees your ex who she felt you betrayed her with is still in your circle, that’s reason enough to continue avoiding you.  There’s no guarantees with this one. Communication and transparency are essential and I hope this is a learning moment for you to check in with boundaries and expectations going forward. Sounds like you’re making the right steps at the moment ||| My ex wife does the same thing to her current bf.  Why are you messaging me at 2 in the morning when youre in bed next to this dude. I mean we have a kid together but shes NEVER messaging me about her. Its always like what's up.  Check out this funny post.  Shit we used to do when we were married. Like send that shit to your bf.  Who's asleep next to you."
When will I stop wanting him to come back?,"I was broken up with 2 months ago (after over a year together) and all I can think about is how much I miss him and how I want him to come back. 
We didn’t break up bc something was wrong with us, he was wanting to work on himself and he needed to be single to do that. 
It took me a month to stop breaking no contact so this is the first real month of us not talking and everyday I hope he’ll reach out and want to fix things and I don’t want to keep thinking like that because knowing my luck I’ll actually never hear from him again. I just want to be indifferent to it now, I can’t hate him as much as I wish I could bc that would make things easier but I don’t know how to not want him back. Ik 2 months isn’t that long but I feel stuck and like I’m going backwards when I know I need to keep trying to move on as much as I hate it so any advice on how to stop obsessing would be very much appreciated 🥲",11,4,2025-06-29 12:08:47,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnd54t/when_will_i_stop_wanting_him_to_come_back/,,,"Besides no contact I guess its time. Time will let you move on and leave that hope behind. For my first ex I was hoping she would come back after 1 year. Then with my recent partner Im still hoping but everyday of no contact a little bit of hope dies. So yeah, time and no contact and focusing on your life till one day you dont care. ||| We’re almost the same with all the timelines, i guess the difference is I’m 6months pregnant.. and it’s true, I’ve waited and was longing for him to come back. I kept on imagining situations that may never come true. But i’m better now.   What stopped me from waiting and wanting?  Acceptance, that it’s all over. That there’s no coming back. I kept on picturing myself happy in the future. I’m making plans for myself and my baby without him. Good plans and dreams, without him. ||| oh boy. We are in almost the same situation. 3 years together and 4 days ago we went no contact after a month of contact.  I chose this decision myself because of his actions. Anyways, obsessive thinking is common for many but each day you will get better as much as you feel like you are going back. You allowing yourself to truly feel everything each day is a step closer to that feeling and mentality you’re longing for. Even though it’s painful each day not speaking to him, it is important you process and feel your emotions. If you are missing his texts, I would suggest writing everything you want to text him in your notes or/and write letters but don’t send them. It will take 6 months to be okay and a year to two to finally reach that point. Take it day by day, be gentle with yourself, and have patience. if it didn’t make this timeline that means something else is brewing for you, a new opportunity which can be for anything. You are so strong and I send you so much love. ||| Did you might talked about what happens in the future after he worked on himself? I feel that you are in the terrible place. Because it seems hard to know whether to have hope or not.   I was really obsessed by my ex as well. What helped me is telling her my feelings and what I desire. To settle things. This helped me to shift to move on."
He said some hurtful things to me today,"It’s been a few weeks of turmoil basically. My ex and I started trying again and he kept ghosting me and standing me up. He eventually explained what has been going on and I understood it, he’s not in a good place. He doesn’t remember much from our conversation today but he really hurt my feelings. He sent me a long string of texts after  sharing that he went to an AA meeting and he’s sorry I got dragged into his mess. He said that he loved me but couldn’t get it together for me. I was going to just leave his messages alone but I remember how it feels to be vulnerable and be met with silence. 

I wish I could have begged him to get it together for me. I want him to be better not only for himself but for me. I want once in my life to be cherished to have the love I deserve from him. His journey isn’t about me though, which hurts. I told him during our conversation I can support from afar and be patient but he basically told me to stay the fuck away from him for my sake. Again I’m left here, back to square one. I crave peace and partnership. I envision our future every silent moment I get. He said the same but he said he can’t do it . He was so hung up on the can’t that he never looked at what he can do. I feel like him saying he’s sorry he can’t be better for me, crushes me. I think to myself deep down that he doesn’t want to be better for me and that when another person comes along he will be better for her. She will get the good of him while I am left in the dust. I don’t ask for much especially since I know he is in a bad place. I wish he told me to just be patient with him. I wouldn’t put a timeline on it, I wouldn’t pressure him. If it means I’m in the background for months, I would have done it because that’s how much I truly love him. 

He made a choice for the both of us again. I’m left here again alone to pick up the pieces of myself. He doesn’t know how badly his words hurt me today. He doesn’t know that I was having a panic attack struggling to breathe and he yelled in my face. He doesn’t know that when he was sobbing that I gave him water and gave him a moment to collect himself. He said some really hurtful things and he doesn’t even know.

The Ex,"I got the worst closure from this relationship ever. Basically things started turning into a domino effect and that’s what led to the break up. There would be times where I went to their house and we had planned it ahead of time with the exact time. When I got there, I called texted. There was no response most of the times. Then he would tell me he was asleep. How could you fall asleep if you knew I was coming over that’s besides the point. I started suspecting that maybe they were cheating on me but they never really went out or had friends. I asked them if I can go through their phone and I went to some sort of PDF app on Samsung and the first picture I saw was a girl. At the moment he told me he doesn’t know how it got in there and it was stated from a while back ago, and he made up a story how when he was playing he clicked on it on automatically saved. Didn’t believe him. Later, then he told me it was his ex. In the past when we first got together I had some pictures of my ex on my phone and he saw him he got visibly upset now is my question you would know if you have pictures on your ex on your phone phone. Mind you there was more images below the one that I clicked, but since I was so upset about the picture of the girl, I didn’t look at the other ones and immediately left. When we last saw each other, I asked to see those photos and he said he had deleted all of them because I got upset, but why would you delete all of them was her other things that I wasn’t supposed to ? Lots of other stuff besides that happened where they forgot my birthday and lied and said they didn’t, but they sent me a screenshot of their calendar for some reason and my birthday was marked on the wrong date, but this was after celebrating my birthday. Before that they wanted to make it up to me by taking us out on our anniversary the day came and never said anything then I mentioned it, and they made up an excuse saying something about work and that they didn’t but I know they forgot. After a day of arguing, they finally told me they did forget. I’m just wondering if if they were emotionally cheating on me to forget things like this or was I just not important enough? If you guys have any advice, please give me some. I just need some closure and need to move on.",2,0,2025-06-29 20:46:58,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnp56l/the_ex/,,,
Anyone else's ex unrecognizable?,"So it's been about 6-months post breakup and I've been doing fairly well on my healing journey. That was until I was on Instagram today and unexpectedly came across an IG story of a mutual with my ex at some random bar downtown at 3am. For context, when I was with this girl she had a very hard time going out. She'd always give me some excuse about her health or how she had to stay home and watch her pets and it was such a hassle to try and get her to come out and spend time with me, to the point where she honestly never came out with me like that. I even remember asking her to come out to the bar and club with me a couple times, but given the fact that she is autistic she would mention how that is not an environment she would choose to be in nor did she want to be around a bunch of random drunk people due to her sensory issues. I understood this and gave her the benefit of the doubt every single time. Especially with her health issues, this girl would almost feint walking up the 4-5 steps leading to the front door of my house. 

Now? I see she's going out almost every weekend, is staying out late in the city (she'd always go to sleep at 11PM) and is even staying at hotels and airbnb's (couldn't even get this girl to stay one night with me at my university house), is dressing more confidently (good for her and nothing wrong with that - just different, that's all), it looks like she's drinking now, walking the streets for long periods of time without her mobility aids, and is in environments that have proven to be of major difficulty and issue in the past. All of the behaviour she is engaging in now she has expressed to me in the past she was VERY AGAINST and had no desire to take part in. So what gives? The girl I know would never think to do these kinds of things, but yet here she is doing the very things the said she never wanted to do, and would always turn down whenever I had asked her to do them with me. She is completely and utterly unrecognizable from the woman I knew during our relationship. 

Can anyone else relate? Has anyone else been through this before? Is there a reason behind this kind of behaviour? ",2,2,2025-06-29 20:45:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnp3it/anyone_elses_ex_unrecognizable/,,,I feel like mine is a totally different person to who I knew as.  Changed her hair colour (back to a depressing purple). She got a tattoo (I don’t like tattoos sorry) and her personality has literally changed to becoming more selfish. While this was all done when I broke up with her. It made me angry and upset because she ruined herself with these changes and it broke my heart knowing she did these things. It felt like the ex I knew truly died (she not dead).  Since then. I’ve blocked her on every platform I can think off and my health has started to slowly get better as I’m not stressed anymore or have really bad anxiety as she caused this to happen to me.  I think I’ve dodged a bullet with this woman and I count myself lucky.  As the reason why they do this to themselves. Well it’s more they don’t respect themselves and they want to make us look bad when really they are responsible for their own actions. Just crazy behaviour if you ask me. ||| She’s moving on. She’s trying on new things. Experimenting. Let her be.
How do you move on from your first relationship and serious one.,"Hi, recently me and my boyfriend of 4 years broke up (I’m crying writing this). We were each others first everything. I took the break up pretty hard. He said he cried and did what he needed to do in 3 days. Apart of me feels like 4 years meant nothing to him. I know it’s just time, but it’s time that I choose to love him. It’s time we choose to fight long distance and military relationship stereotypes. 

The break up hurt. I was emotional and not myself. I said something’s I didn’t mean and feel horrible about them. We argued for the last time and we are no longer in each other’s lives. We argued because I tried to fight for a relationship he didn’t care for anymore. 

I started opening up to a friend about our relationship. For 3.5 weeks I was holding it to myself but I felt like there was no point anymore. It was over and we were never going to see each other again. I wonder how he talks about me to other people now. I wonder if he says I was a horrible person and girlfriend. 

I realized through out our relationship he was an avoidant and I had anxious attachment. It was difficult at times but we made it work. After our last argument I started asking myself if he ever loved me. Was I too much? Why was it so easy for him to let go of me? Why was I so easily disposable? Why was it so easy for him to hurt me and do the things he did to me. 

Even after everything that happened I still love him. I’m upset and hurt. I want him to be okay. I want him to be happy even if it hurts it’s not with me. How do I move on from someone I saw my future with. I am physically repulsed by the idea of someone else touching me the way he did. 4 years with someone who you’ve cried with, opened up with and felt most like your self with gone. How do you forget.

I went through something similar with my GF. For me it has been 3,5 months ago now and just like you i still love her with all my heart, to the point where life feels useless without her. Everything I do, I do in the hope we can try again. She was also my first real love, as was i to her. She was also (i think) somewhat of an avoidant and i am more anxious. We are in the same social circle, so she is still in my life.  You probably don’t want to hear this, but the loving/hurt/desperate feelings will probably stay for a little while. The best you can do is accepting how to “feel trrough the emotions”. I recently read about it in the context of neuroplasticity. What works for me is:  1. Recognize you’ve got a burst of emotions 2. Trying to identify it (is it jealousy, missing him, anger, regret, fear) 3. Feel how you physically feel it and allow yourself to feel it 4. Breathe through it.  Apparently this teaches your brain that the emotions are just temporary.  I’m telling this because this “exercise” really helps me to keep going, eventhough i know she probably doesn’t want me back. I hope eventually i can come to accept that, but till that time i try to work on myself in the hope we can try again once i have regained myself."

"I deserve to be heard, i need to be seen, i didnt get the closure i need. and its breaking me","My girlfriend left me last friday, it felt so fast, so abrupt, out of the blue, so random, well at least on my end. But it is clear now that she had been moving on months ago. I just refused to acknowledge the changes thinking its one of those phases we always get through. I am filled with regrets, hurt, anxiety, and doubt. She was my partner. A year ago I was giving up because I felt like I could not be with someone who could lie to me. She refused to give up and I gave her another chance. The consequence of that was, from that point I treated her like shit. unintentionally, but because my feelings were not there anymore, I was only providing the bare minimum for us and for a year it felt so stagnant for the both of us. The breaking point was when she was demanding all of the things she needs from me and I just couldnt keep up with it given that I dont feel enough for her. But, last week, I mustered up the courage to ignite our feelings again and I planned for our anniversary. It turns out she forgot this date. That's how damaged our relationship was already. Truly broken in every aspect. She felt bad and made it up for us. We ""celebrated"" in another day but after that it was just a mess of arguments rooting form our frustrations that we dont love each other like we did before. We made up like we used to, I thought it was gonna be fine, until I received her message of letting me go as her final act of love. I have never felt pain like this before. She did not give me a chance to say may piece before leaving. I feel as if a blackhole consumed my soul never to return again. I need her to know how much it hurts, how much im suffering, I wouldnt wish this to anyone. This is beyond what I can handle and I cannot function. 

I cannot sleep, cannot eat, i cannot do anything. 

reasons why it got fucked up

\- i couldnt forgive her for the fact she wronged me and in return i treated her like absolute shit, so ofc she lost her feelings and for the past few months she wasnt loving me anymore, at least truthfully, her heart wasnt there anymore, she cried because of familiarity, for comfort, she felt bad, she was guilty, she did not love me anymore, she was there only because she felt bad for me, i can take the blame too, i am accountable, i had my faults, this was fucked from the beginging, insecurity, games from the beginning fucked this up, true love is scary, i have to let her go.

\- this does not deteriorate my value, a failed relatioship will not define me, it doesnt make me any less of a man, i am not my mistakes if i learn from them, i should have loved her more, should have been more understanding.



If truly loved her i would have done more. There was no more initiative from me. The only reason why im so hurt right now is because it was so sudden. it was like lightning, at least on my end. but there were too many signs that this was coming. i just chose to  ignore it. Everything reminds me of her, but thats only because i told her everything that runs on my mind on a daily basis.I made her my  journal, I was at my most vulnerable, without knowing that she was already moving on for months. It was obvious that something changed, but in my head, i thought it was just one of those phases that we can push through together, I did not know that this was the final chapter already. Thats why it hurts. I am naive, stupid even, for thinking someone could be with me while i treat them like shit.

All the random women that ive been talking to cannot fill the void, i know it myself. i even feel guilty for reaching out. they are not the answer but they distract me for a moment or two and for me thats enough peace. i cannot sleep, cannot be awake, i just wish my ex and i never met from the beginning. its in the past already, but it hurts insanely. every movie,series,game,experience, i wish to share with her still. but i know that its gone. i feel like im in a blackhole stuck in my own mind. like that claustrophobic end scene in interstellar, fucks me up that we just watched that in imax.

In a way, her last message tells me everything, everything that there is to know from her side. and for that i am thankful, i just have to navigate through the world now without her. which is like asking a pirate to go to the endless sea without the stars. i am in absolute disarray. work does not feel like anything anymore

"Could use a outside perspective, if you have the time.","I dont know to feel about this and could use someone else's perspective.

Hey Reddit, I’m just looking for an outside perspective on something that’s been sitting heavy with me.

My ex and I officially broke up in January, but we stayed on-and-off until the end of May/early June. Our relationship was toxic — I won’t sugarcoat that. I was in a bad place mentally, emotionally burnt out, and not the partner I should’ve been. At the same time, she was drinking heavily, partying a lot, and eventually got into drugs like cocaine. I'm not trying to villainize her to feel better about myself — I know I contributed to the toxicity just as much. I just want to give full context.

We lived together for almost two years. I even moved my china cabinet into her apartment. After we broke up, I asked for it back, and she refused. We were still talking, but I could feel something was off between us. Despite everything, I told her I wanted to marry her one day — to grow old together. I asked her for clarity, and she admitted she couldn’t commit, that she had issues of her own to work through, but that she still wanted the same things… just not right now.

Shortly after, I filed a petition with the court to get my china cabinet back. But honestly? It wasn’t about the furniture. I was hurt, and I was lashing out. I realized that, canceled the petition, and sent her a message apologizing. I told her she deserved better — someone who wouldn’t try to be manipulative or retaliatory the way I had been.

That was early June. We haven’t talked since.

Fast forward to now: My grandfather recently passed away. She found out somehow and called me out of the blue. She said she was sorry for my loss, told me she was praying for me, and asked if I wanted her to come to the funeral.

I’m not expecting to get back together. I’m not even sure what I’d want if she did reach out again. I’ve been doing my best to focus on my future — I got a new job and have been actively in the process of joining the Air Force, which I was working on even while we were together.

Still, her call shook me. I’m trying not to overthink it, but I’m confused about what it meant and how I should even mentally frame it. Was it closure? Guilt? Kindness? Something else?

I’m not asking if we should get back together — I’m just looking for honest, outside thoughts on this whole situation.

I went nuts begging, calling from burner numbers, I felt insane. Eventually, he answered and I asked, truly why? And he told me it was nothing. That it was just nothing, he just didn't want to be with me anymore.

DO NOT GIVE OR SEEK ACCESS AFTER BREAK-UP,"Hello, Reddit

Here to vent share my opinion about no-contact and why zero access helps healing.

I (30F) was dating a man (30M) for a year. The relationship ended 1 month back, and I am sitting down to share what I have been learning about no-contact and no-access. I was dumped over text without any context or a clean break-up, and I had to self-soothe and accept what happened. Hence what you see below is from my PoV.

**Pre-breakup context:**

My ex and I had a bitter-sweet relationship. He came in my life when I really needed someone to lean on, and I believe he too needed someone. It started off intensely: he found ""the one"" in me after the first date, left his job immediately, moved in with me in the 2nd month with a promise to study and get a better job, smoked up weed every day instead of studying, finally I helped him get a job in my domain and carried his financial and emotional load for 6 months. In the meantime I had started asking him to study but he did not - leading to a few verbal fights. One of these times he was threatening me that he will leave my own apartment, and I, instead of saying ""please don't leave me"", told ""sure please leave, let me know if you would need help to book your tickets."" because he did not have money. That day he slammed his fist against against the wall. And after 3 months, he blamed me for not apologising to him when he slammed his fist... I was SHOCKED. All these while, his mom was almost getting us married (he never proposed nor did I say yes).

Long story short, as all of you may know, it ended how it was supposed to end. I chased this man for another 6 months, trying to explain myself and how I was hurting. He being well read and with his promises of lifelong love, I felt he will have the tools to cope better and understand that I have only good intentions for him. But one day he told me that I am a nagging sour girl with an unwise dream to do a PhD - I had asked him if he can give me some clarity. He never tried to apologize and had shut me down saying I am difficult to live with.

I quietly left. This time, no explanation, no begging, not fight, no chaos.

**Post break-up context:**

I felt an immediate shift in power when I did not react to his childish tantrums. I work 10 hours a day, earn fairly enough to sustain myself, my parents, my pet, and my hobbies. And I realized that my worth is not tied to how this man or no one perceives me. But I still had the need to be seen by him - so I did not block him in Instagram. But just the next day after the break-up, I see him posting a rage-bait saying ""A job is so difficult. Anyone with their head in their ass will think everything is fine."" Well I know this was a ragebait because I did tell him to get a job that pays well and is not a temporary gig. He also posted something like ""going back to my bois after the love that felt like ""i will marry her"" ended lol"".

That's when it struck me that I am letting him mess up with my head.

**So what did my therapist suggest:**

First of all, my therapist wanted us to have a dignified break-up with proper closure because he has always been ""a good guy with bad issues"" in my story. I think any person, who is good or bad in our story deserves a clean break-up (including myself). But since it did not happen, she says:

1. The moment anyone decides that to leave a relationship, and if you were not abusive (did not namecall / hit them / scream at them / anything that is categorized under abuse), their access to our life is over. It does not matter if they apologize today or if they will apologize after 6 months.

**Reason:** Contact gives an impression that I can be accessed periodically on their whims and fancy. You may think its goodwill/old times sake. But it really is lack of our self respect which is = ex thinking ""i do not have to respect her more than how much she respects herself"". Lol never.

2. They do not get to see what we are doing in life, if we are on holidays, if we are partying, if we are crying, if we are married, have kids, because they chose to leave your life knowing that they will lose this access. I KNOW WE WANT THEM TO SEE US AND FEEL THEY LOST SOMETHING VALUABLE. But it does not matter.

**Reason:** Why should we centralize our life around them seeing us happy? Yes, it messes up their head, but trust me it messes up our heads too. We are not as strong and detached as we would like us to believe (this post won't have happened if I were that detached.)

3. You do not get to see what happens to their lives because they too are playing the same game

**Reason:** Access in social media = visibility without context = a false sense of control. You may think ""oh, they are doing great and maybe I missed the boat."" But look at your social media.. its just a photo album, and we always said ""cheese"". It means nothing most of the times.

4. If they ever apologize? Leave them with the void, man.

**Reason:** Hardly any second-chance work. If it works, great. But think if they decide to work on themselves by putting you out of their story instead of trying to be better and do the work with you - then is this not abandonment? Is this something guranteed they will not do again?

5. This can more difficult but most crucial: The person who left, left for some reason. Is this not the time to do self-check-in a bit?

**Reason:** When you have a wound, would you scratch to heal or would you leave it alone with medicines? Here time and therapy are my medicines. We all make mistakes in a relationship. We are also hurt enormously by our partners. Two truths - that you are hurt by someone and that you made mistakes too - can live simultaneously. Instead of focusing on ""why they hurt me?"", is this not an opportunity to shift focus on ""why we do what we do?"".

Access gives us too many stimuli to keep reacting (whether we break no contact or not technically, we still think about them, try to control the situation in our head by making make-shift theories). WE ARE HUMANS FOR GOD'S SAKE. So limited to zero access gives the needed time to be objective, it allows the wound to recover. And it allows us to get our identity back - free from how much we wanted them to perceive us as worthy of love - but just a human who can learn and provide a better form of love.

Let me know how you have coped with breakups. And some wisdom that your therapists may provide you with. :)",17,6,2025-06-29 08:51:31,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lna0r6/do_not_give_or_seek_access_after_breakup/,,6 month(s),"I dropped off all her stuff and began no contact immediately. She chose to abandon me. So I blocked her virtually everywhere. I’m in so much pain and partially seeking closure but I’m in an understanding that nothing will come of it. Only problem is I have a loose end to tie up regarding a trip planned in the fall and it’s all logistics now. I agree not allowing them back in at all makes any sense but we are human and at times can’t help ourselves. ||| This is soooo important. Spoke so much sense with empathy. ||| This came at the perfect time! I left my ex on my TikTok for 2 months post break up and I would be lying if I said I didn’t repost some things to get under his skin and I genuinely felt he was doing the same. He ended up sending me a TikTok after the 2 months and literally that opened the door to continue sharing pointless exchanges for a week. It left me feeling anxious and of false hope. He left me, his answer was a “no.” I needed to accept that and I thought I did until I found myself answering his bait. My therapist encouraged me to choose myself, have dignity and block him BECAUSE I deserve so much better. And cutting that last bit of access I felt so relieved, I’m no longer looking to repost things that could be an indirect msg to him, I’m simply living. I gave him what he wanted which is a life without me."
Almost 2 years,"It's been 1,5 year and I still can't accept. I literally hate him for all he did to me. I've never felt such hatred and anger. He had a friend I was always jealous about when we were together. He was making fun of me being jealous many times. It took him 5 months after break up (probably less, I found out then) to get together with her. He wasn't even brave enough to tell me about it in normal way (we were talking every day, I thought there was hope...). He just jokingly asked what if they were together, then finally told the truth in the message :) We haven't talked since then (March last year). They got engaged and he posts pictures with her showing how happy they are. I hate him so much and I can't stop. I was so shocked last time we talked that I didn't have an opportunity to tell him how disgusting it all was. It's eating me from inside. There is no justice. He hurt me badly and he's happy.

Can not seeing someone often really cause you to lose feelings for them?,"38F, 41M. I was seeing my boyfriend twice a month. When we did we would typically meet somewhere in the middle of where we each lived (30 minute drive each.)

I expressed to him I was really struggling not seeing him more often, more than once. And I told him I was really lonely pretty often. He would say he was doing his best and that because of how much he was working he couldn't see me any more than he was.

On a lot of his days off he would often do his own thing. I was confused and sad he didn't ask me to meet up with him these times, but since I knew he was already so overwhelmed by his life I didn't say anything about it.

When I'd tell him I was lonely he would say he misses me, but that he's not lonely. He said he has to be around people so much at work, he's too drained to see me.

I ended up losing interest in him, and I'm not sure if this played a role in it. It's crazy because I used to find him EXTREMELY attractive but now I look at him and feel nothing.

Am I wrong to think I wasn't prioritized? 

Can not seeing someone often really contribute to you losing feelings for them?",1,4,2025-06-30 00:08:51,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lntmsi/can_not_seeing_someone_often_really_cause_you_to/,,,"I just read an article on the statistics of how people of different ages and sexes spend their time. Men typically spend more time alone. Women spend more time with friends and family. Your needs are very important and if you feel your needs were not being met then you made the right choice. But perhaps you are not being fulfilled in other areas of your life. Are you seeing your family, spending time with friends, prioritizing your hobbies? Have you been traveling? Perhaps your life was lacking and you were depending on him to fill the void. If that is not the case, people are all very different. Perhaps you need a significant other than prioritizes quality time more. Or someone that you share likes and hobbies with. I hope you can find someone who will help you to not feel so alone. I hope you can find things to do on your own that are interesting that don’t require anyone’s company as well. If I can find the study I will link under here. It makes sense to not feel connected with only short bursts of time together. Just be aware that statistics show men generally spend most of their adult life working and time spent with coworkers. So even finding someone else you may experience the same dilemma. Wish you the best 🫶🏻 ||| Of course you can lose feelings for people that you don't see very often.

"3 months into a breakup, 30M","Ended a 5 year relationship because she constantly cheated on me, the first time she did it and it took everything in me to forgive her but I did and just when I thought everything was good, three days before Christmas Day in 2024 I was helping her set up her iPad and a text came in and I saw it and confronted her about it and it was another coworker at her current job, the first time it was a coworker as well , she’s a nurse. I had bought a ring to propose to her in January of this year and I only just returned it two days ago. I felt like I wasted 5 years of my life and I hate it. She loves attention and would talk to other men cause she couldn’t help herself and according to her it’s not cheating cause nothing physical supposedly happened which is a lie. 

She moved on within two weeks and is out partying and has a bf, I blocked her on everything today for my peace of mind. It could just be me but how does someone move on that fast? I’m here crying my eyes out, asking myself what was so bad about me that you had to cheat? I literally wanted her to be the mother of my kids, I designed my house blueprint the way she wanted it and so much more.  How do you move on so fast? If I get into a relationship it’ll be to fill a void and I don’t want to put someone through that. I can’t fantom getting back into a relationship ever again or even anytime soon.  I don’t plan on reaching out to her or anything, that never crossed my mind. ",1,1,2025-06-29 23:51:11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnt9pu/3_months_into_a_breakup_30m/,,,That sucks.
Someone i care deeply for is getting close to someone else,"It's about a celebrity I admire, believing her to be my emotional twin, i just saw her photos with a guy, & now I'm feeling like dying.

Always saw her as the best version of myself, she's the only person I havent contacted but cared deeply for. If something wrong happens with her it will be  traumatic for me. I consider her a part of myself and if someone gets close to her then it feels like I've been betrayed. Death is better than this suffering.

I feel sick to my stomach,"It’s been almost 2 months since he broke up with me. The breakup came out of nowhere for me… we were long distance and didn’t think he could do it. We ended on good terms and we’ve decided to stay friends, but anytime I see pics of him I can’t help but feeling like I want to puke. 

I know I probably shouldn’t stay friends with him, but I don’t know that I can bring myself to cut him off. 

My emotions change so wildly. Some days I feel great, confident, and like I can recover; other days like today I’m disgusted with myself, racking my brain wondering if I did something and he’s just being kind and not telling me, or if there was some ulterior motive here. I have no reason to suspect there was another guy, but I can’t help it when my mind wanders. 

I’m afraid of losing him forever… I thought he was the one. I gave my all and it still wasn’t good enough 🥺 ",1,0,2025-06-29 23:44:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnt4hd/i_feel_sick_to_my_stomach/,,,
Why is she still on my mind?,"It's been 10 months since my (28M) FWB (41F) ghosted me. She was my first everything. We were friends first (my first female friend) and then she slowly talked about becoming FWBs. 

She ghosted me on my birthday last year, claiming ""I only wanted to get in her pants."" I simply asked her if she wanted to have sex but that upset her for whatever reason. Looking back at it all, I think she just wanted a one and done-- I was just too inexperienced to know. 

I've forgiven her for ghosting me and it doesn't hurt anymore, but why is she still on my mind? Does it just take even more time to forget about her?",1,0,2025-06-29 23:41:53,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnt2t7/why_is_she_still_on_my_mind/,,,
Should I give up on my ex?,"Sorry for the long story 


 So me (19f) and my ex(20m) were long distance for a year and he just moved in with me here in April. He broke up with me this June, we’ve had a rocky relationship mainly because of the distance and the fact we are both young. He didn’t grow up around love and rarely received it we have a pretty good relationship we have our issues but our goods outweighs our bads tremendously. When he moved here I started to feel an emotional withdrawal which was weird because at the beginning of the year one of his goals was to understand me and my emotions better which he did he was amazing if I had a problem instead of fighting with me he’d guide me through it then reassure me after so just all around a really great guy so I didn’t understand where the emotional withdrawal was coming from. When he moved in I didn’t notice that I had started to become a problem I’d bring up problems in problematic ways then tell him he doesn’t love me anymore when he’d snap example if he stayed on the game too long (8+ hours) instead of addressing it to him when it happened I’d hold it in then explode on him over something small but really it was about the problem I held in I didn’t notice I was doing this until he broke up with me. I was so devastated because we had through hell and back together and this is what causes us to end? But he explained to me and I took time and reflected and genuinely apologized but he didn’t want to get back together I basically begged him for 3 days because he’s the first guy I’ve fallen inlove with in the first guy I’ve given my body to. He got back with me saying he didn’t really want to leave he was just overwhelmed with emotions and I thought everything was fine because if I knew I was hurting my partner I would’ve stopped but I didn’t find out what I was doing wrong till after we broke up. When we got back together I sort of had this gut feeling that we weren’t ok so a couple days past and I finally asked him “how are you?” “Are we ok?” And that night he came home from work and broke up with me again saying he’s been questioning if he really loved me or not and that he wants a change in his life basically saying he’s fell out of love with me and he was just holding on until he couldn’t anymore. I was heartbroken. I stopped talking to him and packed his things the next day he’s been sleeping in the living room since and I’ve been losing my mind day by day because I still want him I still love him and I still care for him. After a couple days of calming down I invited him in the bedroom to watch a movie and obviously we talked about it because I still wanted him and he told me during the talk that he needs to figure himself out and he doesn’t want to hurt me in the process because hurting me hurts him. He still loves and cares for me which makes it hurt 10x worse I left it alone for a couple more days and last night was my breaking point I texted him explaining how I don’t want to be annoying but how he choose me when I was a horrible partner and now that I’m a good partner he’d rather leave. His response was “ because I am a monster I’ve had this conversation in my head a lot and nothing I come up with seems like enough. But that day It rained in your room i saw myself for the first time how I’ve been hurting people. how I say I want connection but then I pull away. How I keep showing up with this hunger for love, and then second-guessing it the second I have it. How I leave confusion behind every time I go you keep asking me why? how do you just stop loving me? Did you ever? And it’s throws me for a loop everytime because no matter what I say I can’t even trust my own answer I mean well but I can’t do well” my response to this message was “ I feel sick to my stomach. I’m so angry wit you to the point where I don’t even want to cry I just feel devastated, you say you wanna figure yourself out but you’re choosing to run away it’s not “noble” you’re literally just being a coward. I never needed you to be perfect or to never hurt me I just need you to choose me. Do you honestly think I haven’t had second thoughts about you or our love? Well I did and I told you I did because I didn’t want to run from them I wanted to face the facts and accept them so I could continue love you but I’m just so angry because why did you have to move in with me and then do this” and his final reply to me was “ I’m not proud of that. It disgusts me, actually. And what scares me more than anything is that this isn’t new, I thought i would be fine and okay And I promised myself it wouldn’t happen again. But it did. And it happened with you. You, who were steady, who looked at me like I was worth something. And somehow, that made it hurt even more. Because I knew I couldn’t keep doing this to you. I am the thing I’ve been scared of being I take and doubt. I hope and retreat. I say “I care” and then disappear into my own head I don’t think it’s noble to leave this isn’t noble. It’s not clean. It’s not brave.
It’s fear. It’s damage control.
It’s me trying to stop the bleeding before I start pretending I’m not the one holding the knife. I cried in front of you because That was the moment I realized I couldn’t keep lying. That I’m not steady. I’m not grounded. I’m not someone who can love without slowly poisoning it with all the shit I still haven’t figured out in myself. I wanted to believe that being vulnerable was enough. That the crying meant change. That being seen meant I was ready. But I wasn’t and I’m not and that scares me” I love him dearly and don’t want to give up on him because my heart choose him. But I don’t want to be pushy so half of me just wants to let him go. He struggles with anxiety and imposter syndrome so much so it also makes me hesitant I love him and I want him but I need him to want me to I’m sure we can make it work but I just don’t know ",1,0,2025-06-29 23:41:52,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnt2ss/should_i_give_up_on_my_ex/,,3 day(s),

My ex is leveling up,"My [24 F] and ex [23 M] broke up 3 months ago after 4 years together. It was mostly because we were incompatible and because he was complacent and avoidant. I also struggled with mental illness and trauma and he would get overwhelmed by this. He also wasn’t the best boyfriend and was very selfish. Often thinking of himself, not factoring me in his future,  and pretty much just stringing me along.

It’s been 3 months of NC, and I’m going insane. Was I that discardable that he was ably to move on like nothing? 

I also recently found out he got his dream job, and I feel happy, bu also guilty and sad.  Was I holding him back? I supported him so much and wanted us to succeed together and now some other girl will most likely get the best version of him? I’m feel so crushed rn. I do wish him the best, but also had me thinking of the what ifs. Has anyone felt like this before? Any advice?

And it does suck for you that he couldn’t be this way with you, but also because of you, he’s working on being the best version of himself.   Me and my ex ended things for the same reasons, and after a few months we reconnected and she’s actually annoyed / mad with me that I’ve become who she always wanted me to become and wonders why I didn’t realize these things and make these changes earlier.   She broke up with me and it truly broke me, so I didn’t have any choice but to level up and become someone far better than who I used to be. ||| You weren’t holding him back, he was holding himself back by stringing you along when he had no intention of including you in his future. If he doesn’t reflect on his own mistakes in your relationship he will likely have something similar with the next girl he dates. Remember that there is so much more to life than a career. Figure out what the “leveled up” version of YOU looks like. Find something that you can be passionate about enough to put most of your focus on, you will forget about him in no time. ||| It’s normal to think that way but think about it like this, if you were still somehow his gf at this point why would that mean he magically wouldn’t get the job?"
I emailed my ex at 3am,"Ex is from over a year ago. We dated for 6 months and moved too fast in the relationship. He moved in with me and at that point the incompatibility came bubbling up. I was overwhelmingly stressed with playing “house wife” and he didn’t think it was worthwhile to work out the little arguments with me 🤡

But a week after the breakup I was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer. This guy had the audacity to stalk me with fake profiles, and then eventually he drunk booty called me one night

I have felt ever since that he was not merely just the wrong guy for me, but an absolutely toxic and selfish individual who lacks any degree of empathy.

So while I’m “over it” and don’t want to reconcile, a part of me felt like something was left unsaid. And that “unsaid” bit was me sticking up for myself. To stop acting like a wounded animal and call him out for being cruel.

The fact is he probably doesn’t care. But at least now the record shows how I feel. And I feel good about it.

Here’s what I sent:
“””””
I beat cancer without destroying my body, I went through the most terrifying battle of my life, and for everyone that supported me I remain grateful. But all you could do was drunkenly booty call me and then not respond. Drunken booty call a girl who you once said you cared for and introduced to your family, while I was going through literal hell. I think of you sometimes but I’ll never forget that; and I think it’s okay for me to express even this late.

Off my chest!!!! Life is too precious to hold my words back. I don’t want a response.

my long distance boyfriend broke up with me. i dont know how to handle it.,"im really struggling with this. we decided to remain friends, as we both really want to stay in each others lives, but the distance was too much for him. we were together for a year and a half. maybe it doesnt seem like a lot of time to you, but he was the first guy to ever understand me and treat me like a normal person. i also have autism, so i feel emotions a lot stronger than most people. every song reminds me of him. i thought we were okay. i wish he knew that he is more than worth waiting for in my eyes. we originally planned to see each other in march, but he backed out last minute (which i was not mad about) because it was a long flight, he lives in an entirely different country, and it would be his first time in the U.S. by himself. i can fully understand being scared. i was never upset with him for this, and he said that this is what sparked the break up for him. he never went into detail about why he broke up with me, just that distance was a big part of it. i feel so confused. im scared to ask him because i dont wanna make him uncomfortable, or make him feel like im begging him to be with me again. how did you get over your ex? should i try to talk to him about it?",3,3,2025-06-29 17:27:38,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnkbkl/my_long_distance_boyfriend_broke_up_with_me_i/,,,"Alright darlin’, listen close. I’m not gonna sugarcoat this.  He left. That’s the truth. You didn’t push him, you didn’t screw up, he just couldn’t handle the distance. Maybe it scared him. Maybe he didn’t have it in him. Doesn’t matter why exactly. What matters is that he chose to step away instead of step forward.  Now, I get it. First real connection, someone finally saw you and didn’t treat you like a project or a problem. That matters. I ain't gonna pretend it doesn’t. But don’t let that blind you. Just because he was the first to understand you doesn’t mean he’s the only one who ever will. And don’t tie your worth to his fear.  You’re holding onto this “friends” thing like it’s a rope keeping you from drowning, but really it’s just keeping you tethered to pain. You don’t need to go beg for clarity. You already got the answer. He couldn’t do the distance. He made a choice. That’s all the clarity you need.  If he wanted to fight for it, he would have. He didn’t. Let that sink in.  You’re strong. You feel deeper, sure, but that’s not a curse. That means you’ll grieve deep, but you’ll love even deeper when the right one shows up. One who stays.  And me? I got over mine by remembering one simple thing — if someone leaves, they were never meant to stay. So I quit waiting, quit wondering, and went back to living.  You don’t need to talk to him. You need to let yourself hurt, cry if you need to, then stand back up. Life ain't done with you yet. And neither is love.  Keep riding. Keep your head up. You're worth more than someone else's fear. ||| In a similar situation to you (long distance, different countries) he said if we lived closer he thinks things would be different. I’m sorry you know this pain too.  I think the reality is if they wanted to have made it work they would have. When you want something bad enough, you try. But that’s hard to accept.  Mine and I remain “friends” but I wouldn’t even call it that. He’ll snap or call me when he feels like it, on his terms. I’m thinking about blocking him honestly. I don’t feel like he even really cares.  I think staying friends especially when you’re long distance makes it harder because you truly have no idea what they’re doing on the other side which leaves room for you to come up with all sorts of things that may or may not be happening. I know that’s true at least for me."
Today was hard,"My fiancé for three years is in the military. She’s been gone for 5 months now and I have had little contact besides letters here and there. From what she writes and from what she tells me, she talks about me all of the time and is so excited to come home and get married. She and I had some struggles before she left, but we both agreed that we came back strong and we were going to be okay. She felt “unhappy and there wasn’t anything you were doing” is what she said. 

Today she wrote that she still did not feel happy in our relationship. I had feared this day for so long and nothing could have prepped me for it. She felt unhappy and she has tried everything but nothing seems to work to get her out of that funk besides considering me a best friend rather than her soon to be husband. She has always been open and constantly telling me how perfect of a man I am and how well I have treated her. I’ve never been disloyal nor gone behind her back over the three years we’ve been together and haven’t given much of a reason to end things. 

Right now, this is the straw on the camels back and it feels like it’s about to break. I feel like a boulder has crushed half of my life underneath it. I want to stay open minded that maybe when she comes home and we see each other again it will be better, but I don’t want to put myself through this torment of heartbreak if it doesn’t help. I have no one to turn to and no one to comfort me, she was the only leg I truly could stand on. I need help before it might be too late. It doesn’t feel real.

My ex is a completely different person now,"It's been about 3 to 4 years since we broke up from a 9-year relationship and I can't even recognize him. All the things that he used to hate and make fun of before he's turned into. He was a gym rat that was religious hardcore into the right wing demographic and voted for Trump. Now, he's always been the kind of type who would kind of change and act differently in front of other people. But not to this extent, the person he is now is entirely different on really fundamental things. 

He goes to gay pride parades dresses flamboyantly wears sun hats. He is about 200 lb heavier and listens to pop hits and country. He only listened to metal before and country music was something that he used to make fun of before, he'd shut the radio off in my car if it was ever on. He is a staunch atheist now and seems to be afraid of the sun. He used to work shirtless in the yard and now he has all kinds of stuff covering the sun from him, big hats and umbrellas. I really don't understand how someone can change so many things that seem fundamental to him before. I feel like the old him would have beaten up the new him lol.

I've totally moved on but it was a bit alarming to see just how different a person can be. I've known him since he was 14 and the kind of person he is now is the kind of person he would have made fun of in the past for sure. Towwards the end of our relationship I realized that maybe he was a bit of a psychopath, especially towards the end when I learned a lot of truth about him and a lot of the lies came out. He manipulated so many for selfish reasons so I'm almost certain this is another kind of manipulation really.

Recent breakup but i still love her idk if she feels the same.,"I’m currently going through a breakup with my girlfriend of almost five months. She ended things after I talked to my cousin about a situation we had. I realize now that I crossed a boundary with her — something I’d never done before — and I regret it deeply. I still love her, but it doesn’t feel like she feels the same anymore.

Even though I know we’re not together, part of me kept hoping to see even the smallest sign that it still meant something to her. That maybe I still mattered. But I haven’t seen that, and it’s tearing me apart. I catch myself waiting to see if she’s online or if she’ll text, even when I know I shouldn’t. I know I should let go and move on, but it’s hard. It feels like I lost a part of myself.

I still think about where she’s going, what she’s doing, who she’s with — and I know I shouldn’t, especially after the breakup. She went out with her friends recently and I felt insecure, even though we’re no longer together. I hate feeling like this — so stuck and so empty.

Wife (30) of 4 years (8 together) cheated on me (35) with her male work colleague (50),"Apologies in advance for a long one.

I recently found out that my wife of 4 years, together for 8 years, has been (emotionally) cheating on me with an older work colleague since Christmas, which became physical in May this year. She told me that since last summer, she felt her feelings towards me wane, and that she no longer saw me romantically, but more as a blood relative. One of the reasons she put this down to was a lack of intimacy, sex and passion (mostly from my part). She also said she no longer saw me as man and that I was lacking ambition, mostly regarding my career. 

In my head, I think (possibly a big) part of the reason why this gradually started happening since last summer was due to multiple external factors (as well as internal ones within the relationship). Last summer we bought out first house together, and were moving house for those months. The house also needs a lot of work done to it, which was causing us stress. In October, I was applying for a promotion, when suddenly my work declared they were in a massive deficit and job cuts were inevitable, as was a massive downsize all around. This still hasn't been fully resolved, and while I still have a job there, so much is uncertain. It is also frustrating that I missed the job opportunity, but that's life - I think this played a big role in her seeing me as less of a man, because I wasn't looking for other jobs and promotions and I was set in my ways in my hybrid job. She felt she was the breadwinner and the one wearing the trousers. And I put my career aside so she could focus on hers, as I knew this was important to her. It's not that I gave up on improving myself, but I saw it as more of a hiatus for her to prioritise her career. She also felt I let myself go in terms of hygiene (mostly because I get gas due to stomach issues, and apparently I burped in her face during intercourse once - I genuinely don't remember doing that, but will take her word for it). 

Then, at Christmas her family cat died around about the same time her mum found out she has cancer (currently being treated). In February this year, my family dog died and around the same time my wife ended up in A&E with extreme back pain, which we later discovered was due to herniated disks in her lower spine (something still causing issues). This was also a big reason for the lack of intimacy, and I saw her as fragile, due to the amount of pain she was in.

We are separated now, after I recently discovered she cheated - which she finally admitted and broke down for me (I'm aware this is her account of things, and I should take this with a pinch of salt, as she is a liar). She said she noticed this older man since last Christmas, and he gave her butterflies, something which no man had done since she was a teenager (which was a kick in the teeth for me, knowing she didn't feel that way about me), and since February she actively started pursuing him, finding excuses to speak to him and get to know him. Eventually they started talking, she gave him her number and they went for coffee, where she admitted she was married, but confessed her feelings about him and lack of feelings towards me. This then blossomed. Originally I became aware of her feelings towards him back in April, when I could sense distance growing between us, but she said she was confused (something she still says, even now). She seems him romantically and with interest, but me with love because of our history (not sexually). I initially offered couples therapy, even up until the end (when she finally admitted it got physical), but she always refused and admitted herself she had given up on our relationship. She said a reason for this is because she had suggested therapy in the past to discuss our issues, by which she was referring to me, but ai refused. She said I was a ""mommy's boy"", because I take care of my mum and she felt I always prioritised my mum (and my other family members) before her - which I disagree with, as I feel I prioritise my family in general, of which she was a part of - but that's her views. 

In May, our relationship came to a slow death when I caught her lying about spending the night away with him. She said she was with her friend, but had in fact went away for a romantic night in a different city with him, staying overnight. When she got caught, she insisted it had only been kissing and that they stayed in a hostel. Which deep down I knew was rubbish, but a part of me wanted to believe her. She also got upset at me for spying on her. I left our house, went back to my mum's to get some space. My family found out and obviously their views towards her changed. This upset my wife and I think brought the relationship even further to the point of no return. I also said some things in anger, but eventually apologised (for what I said) once I calmed down. 

I accept that the relationship is dead, and what we once had is now lost, but I can't help the feeling of the rug being pulled from under my feet. Before all this, we were finally getting ready to plan for children (which she said she always wanted with me), and though I'm glad there are no kids involved, as this would be so much harder, I feel frustrated (mostly at myself for my failings in the relationship, as I'm aware it takes two - despite the fact her actions were the final blow), at the situation of our relationship and with my current circumstances. I was finally at a point in life where I felt everything was coming together and now I feel robbed. I feel inadequate because I'm 35, lost my marriage and wife, my home (for now - I plan to contest this eventually, as we co-own it), the imagined family I was planning for and the fact I am back living at my mum's, which just makes me feel like such a loser. I'm also frustrated and feel my situation makes me seem less desirable when the time comes and when I feel ready to move on to a new relationship, which admittedly isn't now and I know situations change. I'm also so confused, because all of the things she's done: cheating, being with an older man and with someone who has family tona previous marriage or partner, are all things she was totally against in the past. She also made me feel bad about having female friends, often got jealous and would say things to me about how many other men noticed her, were eyeing her up etc. I'm aware this comes from her own insecurities, but can't help but feel odd about her actions, since they show me a different woman from the one I married. 

I guess this is mostly a vent, but Im also looking for ways to help cope. I'm considering therapy, but will need to save up for a few sessions as this isn't cheap.  I'm not suicidal or anything, just severely deflated.  I should also point out all communication has stopped, except for the essentials, like legal matters and the house.

Go find a lawyer, if you have evidence of her infidelity take this in account for your divorce case to get a better settlement. Don’t interact much with her, be absolutely indifferent, that drives those cheaters crazy. Try to occupy yourself with activities like gym or outdoor events.

She's being dishonest, devious, and a low down cheater and she's mad at you. That's rich! What a piece of work.   Doesn't think your a man because you lost your job opportunity thru no fault of your own? A good spouse supports their partner thru good and bad times.

This thing she has is just a fling and she'll get tired of him and cheat on him also, so he'll get the same treatment as you soon enough. Hopefully Karma will catch up to her also.

Just saw prenatal vitamins pop up in my grocery store app's 'bought before'. Ex-fiance still has my grocery store club card. I want to ask for it back.,"Ex-fiance. Emotional cheated, possibly physically. Moved in with colleague he said he wasn't in love with straight after I moved out.

I made all the efforts to separate our things fairly, he didn't care. He had my grocery store club card in his wallet and never returned it. It's been a year since I moved out.

The app for the store has a favourites that includes everything you've bought in the last year and i just saw prenatal vitamins. I've never bought any before. It makes me sad, because, well, we were going to get married and have children, we already named them and then everything went bam.

I just really want my clubcard back, like he can get one easily for free. I just. I tried to make sure we had a clean cut but ugh, like I really don't need to know they're pregnant. I had an instinct this woman like him. I built this man up. I know he's a liar, a coward, and I honestly don't believe would've been a great dad, but I still have the dream unreal version of him in my mind. It's a dream I've actually given up on currently, I don't want it, but it's still sad because I know I could've just pretended to not see anything and go along with it so I can have a family.

It's really disorientating to have this woman who he was 'not dating' before we broke up, and he said 'he wasn't in love' with when he decided he'll move in with her before I even left. It all feels gross to me, I left a lot of stuff in that flat, i didnt really want anything i shared with him. I took what was mine and bought with my money. I want to have no ties to him and him having this thing, this silly card, that I think actually has my name on it feels really weird.

Do you think it'll be really weird to ask him to return my card? And how to phrase it so it isn't weird.",1,2,2025-06-29 23:07:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnsco6/just_saw_prenatal_vitamins_pop_up_in_my_grocery/,,,Just go to the store and tell them that your card was stolen and that you'd like a new card to be associated with your account.
We ran into each other a year later on the subway,"We had a really special connection, maybe even once-in-a-lifetime, and didn't break up because a lack of love, but because life was taking us in two completely different directions. He moved away across the country. I thought I was over it. I really did. I was moved on and doing well.

Then yesterday, I was taking the metro back from the pool, and for some reason my train was delayed. There was a lot of commotion on the other side of the station (people going to a concert), so I happened to be watching them through the window of a subway car. And then, like some fucked up movie script, I see him walking right on the other side of that window,  looking through it right at me. We made eye contact for a second. It was unmistakably him.

What's worse is I'm not even supposed to be in this city, the one he moved to. I don't live here. I landed an internship and changed my summer plans last minute to come. Seeing him has opened up a whole can of emotional words. I just wish things could be different, could've ended differently.",3,5,2025-06-29 17:08:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnjuvj/we_ran_into_each_other_a_year_later_on_the_subway/,,,"holy shit ||| Yeah, that hits hard. Seeing someone you thought was behind you suddenly standing right there brings all the old shit flooding back.  That connection you had? Real. Rare. But life pulled the rug out from under it. You didn’t break up because you stopped loving each other. You broke up because the universe had other plans.  Now you’re thrown back into the mess, and it feels like a second chance staring you down. But don’t get caught in the nostalgia trap. That moment was just a moment. A reminder, not a rewrite.  What you do with that reminder is on you. You can let it open old wounds or use it to understand what you really want moving forward.  Sometimes the past walks by to teach you, not to trap you. Don’t get stuck wishing for a different ending. Use it to fuel your next chapter."
"Met up with my ex, please help","Hi guys, I came here because I need strangers perception in this story. So back when I was 19 I started dating Jake. Jake was amazing guy and we were so in love. I met his family, he met mine. I adored his sisters and would always hang out with them and his mother. They were such an amazing family to be around and I was always so grateful. We were together for 3 years. One day he just stopped responding to my texts. I was confused. Later that night I called him and he declined my call. Then his oldest sister texted me saying to never talk to them again, I should stop contacting Jake. I was so confused and asked her what was going on. She told me to stop acting dub and called me a whre. I was genuinly so confused because I had no idea what was going on. Next month was terrible because his almost entire friend group would text me these disgusting messages calling me names. It was steaight up ab*se. I didn't want to leave the house, I was in a horrible place mentally. After a month it finally stopped. Few months after his bestfriend texted me to meet up. At first I did not want to but then he called and told me he just wants to give me closure because he doesn't think I deserve all of this. So I met up with him. And basically what happend is that someone told my boyfriend they've seen me making out with some other dude in the club and then went with him and never came back. I was shocked, because everyone knew i never went clubbing. I started bawling my eyes and his friend just hugged me and said he knows i didn't do it and thats why he needed to tell me why everything went down. He told me he tried talking some sense into my boyfriend but he wouldn't listen. He was the one that made all the other friends stop texting me. I asked him who spread that story he said he had no idea and that my boyfriend never told him. He also told me my boyfriend is horrible not eating, not leaving the house. He wanted to set up a meeting without my boyfriend knowing i would be there but i refused. We said our goodbyes. That all happend 3 years sgo and I haven't heard from any of them because we live in big city. The truth is i never got over him or us. I still love him to this very day. I miss him so much my heart aches everytime i think about him. Last week he started following me on instagram. Few minutes after I got a text from him asking me to talk. I agreed. I haven't thought about it for a second. We met up day after and he started bawling as soon as he saw me. He then hugged me and started apologizing. We sat and he proceeded to tell me story how it all started. Basically his older sisters friend was always in love with him and none of them had idea about it. She was in their lives since they were kids so when she came one day telling him she saw me making out with a dude and leaving with him all of them believed her. A month ago she accidently reavealed the truth. He was telling his sisters how he started talking to this one girl and the friend looked pissed and straight up said:""well i didn't separate you from your ex so you can be with another girl"". He said his heart started hurting so bad the moment she said that. His sisters were pissed. He had a panic attack and ended up in er. When he told me that i was pissed but also kinda relieved. He asked to get back together beacuse after all these years he still loves me and has never stopped loving me. I told him I also never stopped loving him but i dont think this relationship has any future. Because how awkward would it be to meet up with his sisters and friends after all those nasty messages. Not just that, but the fact he believed that friend without even having a chat with me hurt me a lot. He didn't even give me a chance to explain and talk to him. I told him the first few days were so confusing because I was getting such a terrible texts and for something I didn't even know ""happend"". He told me he doesn't think it would be awkward because his mom never stopped talking about me or how much she misses me and his sister also have deep regrets and would like to apologize to me. He then said to think for few days and we will meet up again. After that I got messages apologizing from all his friends and sisters. But the thing is i really dont want to get back together with him. I do, but i don't. I cant explain it i dont think that would be a good decision for me. I told this to my friends and they are rooting for us to get back together and my gut is telling me no. So i needed some other perspective. I know this is long but i hope someone atleast reades all and helps me",1,1,2025-06-29 22:54:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lns22z/met_up_with_my_ex_please_help/,,3 year(s),This story is bizarre.

You need to break it down to the science - you don’t miss her - YOUR brain misses her because your receptors are missing the dopamine and breaking no contact is the fastest way to get it. Compare it to alcoholics. If you are an alcoholic, you are getting dopamine from drinking. Then if you try to quit, it’s the hardest thing to do and your brain is telling you to drink even though it’s bad. Same here. You are an addict to your ex - and need to treat this as a detox from her. Stop reaching out. Block her. No viewing instagram / old pics, etc. This will pass. Humans are meant to endure pain. Process feelings. Move on. As much pain as it’s feeling, you need to drop the act of worrying about her. You don’t really care - you just want the dopamine from her reaching back out.

Please help to recover from a traumatic experience,"Please if you could hear me out I talked to a man who I thought we would be together for life. He said to me we are friends, I didn’t listened.

"3-Year Relationship on Pause for 8 Months – I'm Focusing on Healing, but Still Unsure What to Do","
I’m a 26-year-old male, and I’ve been in a relationship for 3 years with a 27-year-old woman who means a lot to me. About 8 months ago, she said “yes” when I asked her about marriage, but since then, communication has drastically reduced. I’ve made mistakes, I’ve grown from them, and I’ve tried to support her silently—but I now find myself in a space where I’m not sure what direction to take emotionally.

This is not about judging anyone. I’m not here to ask if I’m right or wrong. I just want advice from people who’ve experienced similar uncertainty, growth, or silent endings.

---

### **Our Story (Briefly):**

* We met in college, became friends, and started dating seriously 3 years ago.
* She had to drop out of college due to family issues, but I encouraged her to pursue her degree later, which she’s trying to do now.
* She’s deeply spiritual, responsible toward her family, and prefers doing things on her own. I admire that.
* I suggested she resign from a tiring job and focus fully on her studies. She moved back to her native village to prepare and help at home.
* Her phone is shared with her mother, and she's often surrounded by relatives, which limits her ability to call or message freely.

---

### **What’s Happening Now:**

* For the last 8 months, communication has been minimal—usually one message a month from her saying something like *“You understand me, I’m sorry.”*
* She doesn’t reply to my messages or calls. I message only occasionally, never in a pushy way.
* She is spiritually involved (once said she’s reading *Shiv Charitra*) and hasn't told me clearly what's going on emotionally.
* She still changes her WhatsApp DP regularly, which confuses me because she doesn’t respond to anything I share—like job links or support material.

---

### **My Past Mistakes (Which I Acknowledge):**

* I struggled with alcohol. It affected our calls and how I showed up for her emotionally.
* During one of my government exams, I ignored her calls, especially during a trip to Pune when I was out with friends and drinking.
* I was drunk the night she said “yes” to marriage.
* I removed her from a website project due to delays—something I should’ve handled better.
* She once asked for a spiritual ritual (havan) in her name, which I didn’t take seriously at the time.

These are things I regret, and I’ve taken real steps to improve.

---

### **What I’m Doing Now:**

* I’m **cutting down drinking**, joined the **gym**, and am **preparing seriously for government exams** (civil engineering).
* I’m trying to build stability—emotionally, financially, and mentally.
* I’ve often deleted her contact to move on, but I still sometimes send her things that might help her career.
* I’ve thought about visiting her native place (where I used to work as a PE), not to confront her, but to gain clarity—for both of us.

---

### **What I’m Looking For:**

I’m not asking “Am I right or wrong?”—I know where I failed, and I’ve been working on myself.

Instead, I’m looking for perspective from people who have:

* Gone through long phases of silence in a serious relationship.
* Held on silently, wondering whether to keep hope or move forward.
* Balanced love with self-respect while healing.

I (22f) feel blindsided and hurt by my (22m) boyfriend dumping me,"So I 22f had been dating my boyfriend 22m for a year and everything was going fine at least so I thought this past month he proposed a break at the start of it saying he had been thinking that we maybe needed a break or some time apart because he felt suffocated said break lasted all of 4 days before we ultimately got back together and everything is fine. Fast forward two weeks and he starts acting weird like quiet and he only gets quiet when he is upset so I tried to ask him what was wrong and he said nothing but I knew he was lying because he only acts that way when he is mad/upset later that day he FaceTimes me and I’m on guard cause I feel like something is wrong he is acting like nothing is wrong so I start to relax but suddenly he is like we need to talk about something so I get worried because that is never good and he tells me he wants to break up and so I ask him why and he says it’s cause there is a part of his brain saying what if there is someone else out there basically I was his first girlfriend so that definitely contributes to it but up until this last month he was set on the fact I was the one he wanted to spend the rest of his life with so his reasoning for breaking up caught me off guard and the break up in its entirety blindsided me since we were fine to my knowledge

If they truly love you they’ll naturally stray away from things that they know will hurt you.,"26M & 23F I have no idea how many times my ex gf would become upset when I didn’t pay attention to her, everytime we would talk it would be her guy coworker I did not want to hear about men.She started going to things with him eats, six flags, concerts and parties ( with a group).I am never the controlling type. You’re free to do whatever you want. After she dumped me I even brought up the guy and she was getting annoyed bc she does see him platonic. Well they ended going on a trip together same room. I found out that he confessed his love for her and now she has to find a new job bc it’s weird at work. The core reason why things went sour was literally bc of her guy friends. I was always right. I was straight getting disrespected during and after. I broke nc after I found out she just ignored nit even to get back together I just wanted to hear I was right and also kinda nosy about what happen lol ",5,4,2025-06-29 15:01:11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lngrq7/if_they_truly_love_you_theyll_naturally_stray/,,,"Why is it so hard for people to understand what they did wrong? Same happened to me, this guy had CLEAR intentions with her, he was also a co-worker, I never knew if he confessed his love or something like that but he invited her to the cinema, to eat, etc. but these plans were always of two people only. For me this was like a date! I don’t know man. If I were in my ex girlfriend position, the sole act of hoping in another guys car would feel so disrespectful to my partner. I was also never the controlling type but come on, she had just met him, we’re are not stupids. If she had met him for long I would understand but no. This last event was the thing that took down my relationship and I did tell her this and I even got mad and I told her things that I regret sometimes but yeah, why am I too empathetic with her when she didn’t event care for my feelings? These kind of people when things go wrong they tend to sabotage relationships so they can leave faster. They just care for themselves, and if you tell them that, oh lord, be prepared. They will never acknowledge until life really gives them someone like them or worst."
I'll never understand it,"On Monday he made love to me. On Tuesday he overheard an online class I had with a student, he paid me a compliment by telling me I'll be a great teacher someday. On Thursday I helped him prepare for a big interview. We were excited at the prospect of moving to a new country together and a fresh start. On Friday he came home after a late night with friends and told me all about it, we laughed, and he cuddled me through the night. On Saturday morning I woke up the happiest I'd felt in a while. He gave me morning kisses. On Saturday afternoon he decided he was done with me. After 3 years. After being the ""love of his life"". After making his mantra during hard times, ""we'll figure it out like we always do.""

His reasoning: he lost himself in the relationship, he needs to find himself again, he's too emotionally exhausted to continue. Ie: all nice ways of saying ""you don't make me happy anymore."" So now here I am. In 3 days, moving back home to my country. Him being okay with me being gone forever. Just like that.

"He ended it 3 weeks ago. He just messaged me again. Ladies, I need your help","So, we weren’t technically in a relationship. But we were seeing each other for a month. We barely saw each other. But besides that, he was like Prince Charming to me. The way he looked at me, touched me, complimented me, the things he said….. all looked frikken genuine! Even when I would surprise him at work (he works as a bartender in a lounge), he was soo happy to see me. At one point he told a guest that I’m his woman! And I was very supportive of him and gave him space and never pressured him about anything. But a few days before ending it with me, he wasn’t calling me cute nicknames anymore until he finally said that “I want to be alone and listen to myself. This has nothing to do with you. I just feel a little lost. I hope you understand me”.
That was his message. 
He continues to watch my insta stories. 
Now I get a message from him: “how are you? Just wondering of you. How’s your father? I think I can ask you these questions, because I’m not your enemy”


Honestly I don’t even know what to say to his message.  
HERES THE THING there is a part of me that is scared that if I don’t reply to his message he will unfollow or block me. And thats like extra punishment and rejection from him and feel like he erased me from his life like I didn’t matter.

Sounds like he blindsided you with the initial... breakup of sorts, which is a bit of a red flag. It's nice to be with people who keep you in the loop of where their head is at or where it's gradually going and I think he could have communicated it or discussed it better, not to mention give you the microphone to get your own closure, questions answered, and such.  As for how to respond, I mean part of it depends on your intentions. I'm not sure I'd think so much about him unfollowing/blocking as being a form of rejection, if anything you're in the position to reject right now and he's the one following you (still) to begin with so he didn't really erase you per-se.  ""Hey, good to hear from you! I'm doing ____________. My father is (as much or as little) thank you for asking."" Basic formula, but of course I'd expect you to add to it in some way. Warm and friendly, up to you if you want to ask questions back to encourage more discussion and if not, minimal questioning and just keep it overall simple."
In the end I feel like a loser.,"Im sorry about the rant. It's been almost a year now, I got dumped, it was ugly, i weeped begged did all the things you shouldn't and then I covered it up by saying that you did it because you cared. I didn't even have the balls to delete old photo or block them from my texts. Amd last month when I was moving away from the city where I made these memories I texted them again like a dumbass to meet and idk why I expect3d it to be different. 

Soo I did it delete all the texts and blocked them from whatsapp and stuff but again me being me a hopeless dumbass, did not block them on ig. Cuz I expected still. 

And today i saw their story after a very long time and they are out in a trip I guess with a new partner. And I still got sad and anxious. You know i always thought if they dont block you and you dont its a draw, its not its a loss for them one who still is hopelessly expecting things that they know is not going to happen. I feel like Such a lossr I wasted a whole year of my work health and growth on this and I still am wasting on this.

How can I stop blaming myself the whole time?,"I know we both made mistakes. I know no relationship ends because of one person alone. But my mind keeps looping this narrative that I ruined everything. that if only I had been more secure, more emotionally stable, more kind, less reactive..then maybe he would have stayed.

He said I was too intense, too emotional, too much. And I started believing that.
But the truth is, he had started pulling away long before we broke up. I think he had burned out emotionally! like a pursuer who kept trying to reach me, until he finally gave up. And when I did start changing, when I became softer, more open, more emotionally available..he had already given up. :(

I’m stuck in this place where I take all the blame.
I’m obsessing over every argument, every moment I misread him, every time I tried to fix or explain myself instead of being vulnerable.
I know I’ve grown so much since the breakup, but I feel like it’s too late. He’ll never see the version of me I’m becoming! The version that could’ve loved better.

How do you let go of this self-blame?
How do you forgive yourself when you know you were part of the problem… but also know that the other person wasn’t perfect either?

I want peace, but I feel like I have to earn it by carrying all the guilt first.

I broke up with my ex a few months ago. Since then, she’s been constantly messaging me—not to get back together, but to pretend we’re still friends, as if nothing ever happened. I barely responded and gave her very little attention. We rarely talked, and honestly, it’s for the best. We both need to move on.

At first, I felt a little empty, but over time, the constant messages started to wear on me. So today, I decided to unfriend her on all social media. I don’t want any more contact.

Dumped over my dogs,"11 months into our relationship she (f32) ended our relationship (myself m35) because I have two labradors, one of which I’m planning to have a couple of litters from over the next several years. She said that she has a phobia of large dogs and if we were to have children then it would be really dangerous to have large dogs around her and the potential children.

I explained to her that my plan for the dogs had been in place for 18+ months. That Labradors are great family dogs and are excellent with children.

As a result, this apparently flagged that I would be a questionable father… for allowing “dangerous” dogs around children. Side note, my labs are well trained and friendly with everyone- aka the stereotypical Labrador. 

In our first month of dating we went walking along the beach … with my dogs…so you can imagine my surprise when they became a problem after all that time.

I was sad when this revelation came about and the dumping that followed a few days later.

"Breakup of a good, healthy relationship","He was so sweet to me, I don’t think I’ve felt more emotionally safe with anyone. There wasn’t one bad memory I had with him. We had been dating for five months before very suddenly learning he had to travel/move away for most of the next year for work. He’s really passionate about his career path. I’m not sure how to move on from this. It’s just pure sadness. I feel so defeated to finally find someone who can be sooo good in so many aspects, and neither of us want to leave each other. But he doesn’t feel like he can give enough attention to a relationship with his work. Then after that, there’s a good chance I could be moving away. 

I can’t be mad at him, I can’t say, “I can find better” because he was the better, I can’t blame anyone. I don’t know how I’m supposed to move on and “get over” that. I will not be able to change the fact that I’d take him back any day. Hope the next person can deal with that fact??… I can’t hope anything will change because it won’t. Losing a good ass person is so much harder. It doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t feel right. There’s no lesson to be learned. 

The dating pool is terrible and it’s highly unlikely for me to find anyone who is that good anytime soon (I was single and dating around for 3 solid years prior with so many first dates. I know what’s around. If I told you about every single one that didn’t work out, you’d agree and say I don’t deserve their kind of treatment). If I don’t somehow win the lottery again in the near future, I’m going to be so damn depressed dating shitty man after shitty man and men that are just not a good match for me and repetitively rolling the dice with so little hope. It’s distracting but it is not fulfilling.   More stressful and dramatic than anything. But I eventually will have to, because I know what I want and it isn’t being single for life.

Broken up with by my boyfriend of 2 years (he's avoidant im anxious),"Hi,

I (20F) got broken up with by my boyfriend (23M) on Friday night. He was my first boyfriend, first love, first relationship. We met when I was 18 and he was 22. It didn't work out because the past 6 months have been the cycle of push and pull, and at the end of the talk we hugged, said I love you, I packed his things and he left. He said he was going to block me on insta, but i could text him if i needed him and we still have each others locations.

I think I am in denial that it's over, because a part of me just believes he is going to come back; I can't imagine him not in my life. At 3 AM the day of the breakup I texted him saying I already miss him, and I couldn't sleep because my right side of the bed was so empty without him and I knew we were done but it didn't feel real. He said ""I know, me too; it's hard on both of us. My line is open if u ever want to talk. we will be okay..."" I then replied saying thank you, door's open to talk, don't hesitate to reach out we will be okay love you. We are now in no contact it has literally only been 2 days but I miss him like crazy. Friday night and Saturdays were our days and I am so scared for this Friday and Saturday. Everything reminds me of him, and I see him everywhere; in things people say, in different drinks, etc.

I don't even know why I am posting this; I just am in denial, pain, and having crazy mood swings; I guess I'm asking if this is normal? I really want to heal and cross paths with him again; It feels somehow worse we ended it out of love because I feel like there was no closure.

I just really need some advice on how to go forward, if I can hold onto hope or not; I'm just really hurting please be nice",1,0,2025-06-29 21:54:24,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnqpxh/broken_up_with_by_my_boyfriend_of_2_years_hes/,,,

I want nothing more than my ex to reach out to me apologise for his absence and hold me close so I can cry and sob and hear him say that he missed me and he is sorry and won’t leave me again.

I just want my best friend back.,"For 7 months she was my best friend. I don't want to let that go, but then again, over the past two months after the breakup she's become a completely different person. She started vaping again (she'd been clean for 4 years), she's drinking even more than she did (although she did a lot when we were going out). She's just a completely different person, and she's not the same girl I fell in love with which makes this so difficult.

Boyfriend broke up with me at another man's request,"Almost 2 weeks ago he told me his Sponsor (AA) advised him to break up with me ""for now"".

He'd been having $$$ problems. Like donating plasma to pay rent.  

Communication had been low in the weeks leading up to this ( I suspect he's avoidant) but he responded when I reached out. But I learned texting got a response where calls didn't.  

Felt neglected. 

He said he felt he was failing me.  ""Worried about money"" and ""I deserved better"".  

Stayed together. 

His phone got shut off,  I didn't know and his phone just went to voicemail,  no disconnection message.  We were LDR but built a relationship in person first. We were planning to close the distance. 

After a week I called his local PD for a welfare check.  I was genuinely concerned.  

He called me right after.  This is when he said his phone had been disconnected.

Said he'd text me next day.

He did. One word text ""hi"".

I responded in kind, ""hi"". Nothing for hours so I sent him a message again saying I missed him and wasn't sure what was happening.  That ""hi"" seemed cold and out of the ordinary.  That I wished I hadn't send the che k but I was worried bc of his silence. Asking him how he was feeling about us. (ugh 😥). And told him financial problems were normal,  he shouldn't hide himself bc of them.  But he should think about what he really wants. I told him I loved him. 

He texted me that he was at work and would call me next day. 

He did which is when he told me he was advised to end it. He sounded cold and defeated. He said he thought he could handle everything and didn't want to break up. But it's not fair to either of us if he can't give his all. 

At least this helped me take him off the pedastal I had him on.  Another man had him end something so special. Probably got a kick out of it too.

These few weeks were really tough on me mentally, as it felt like I was starting to be convinced that I didn’t treat her as kindly as I thought. 

A week later, she called me and told me how much she regrets it. How she spent a lot of time reflecting and she had realized this came from a place of fear, and how she’s so regretful and ashamed for self-sabotaging. She acknowledged that I treated her really well and that she’s sorry for everything that happened. She really emphasized how sorry she was. She extended an olive branch and said that if I think there’s something worth saving, that she’s willing. 

I struggled to say anything over call because I was crying so hard. I had been grieving something else for a week. This was a lot on my nervous system. All I was able to say was that I need some time to respond, and she assured me that’s completely fine. She assured me that she’ll be here when I reach out.

It’s been a week since, and though I haven’t entirely decided what I want to do, I’m leaning towards trying to work things through. She is somebody I love more than life itself. This was also genuinely, like, the only “rough patch” we’ve ever had. She’s a generally insecure person and it comes out in bad ways sometimes, but I guess I just never imagined this would happen. It’s been a difficult two weeks because I honestly believed we were never talking again at first, and then that changed, so it’s been a bit jarring.

I want to work things through but I don’t know if I’ll ever feel safe with her again. I don’t want to hold this mistake over her head, especially because this is the only time she’s ever let her insecurities affect our relationship like this, but I’m also trying to look for myself here, because I want to be in a relationship I feel secure in. These past two weeks have been so brutal. I recognize these things need time, and that trust needs to be rebuilt. 

I’m gonna sit on it for a few more days and then reach out and talk to her. This has been a really difficult time, and I just want to make sure I’m not acting rashly—based on emotions. I want to sleep on it and wake up feeling the same way for days before concluding. 

I would appreciate any kind of advice. Literally any.

I think if we were to ever reconcile I'd need him to be willing to see a therapist, at least for a while, so when his insecurities creep up, he has the tools to work through them in a way that isn't destructive to our relationship. I think it's a fair boundary, because at the end of the day, my partner's actions very much affect my mental and physical health, and I need to be able to feel like if we were to reconcile, the same thing wouldn't occur again, and it is much more likely to, if the issues that led to the breakup are not addressed in any meaningful way."
Am i crazy or something?,"So i had been dating this girl for a little while, we go to school together and live close to each other.

I didn’t know what sister she was talking about bc she has so many and i’ve only met 2 of them. so i asked if she was the one dating the mexican guy (side note, this was asked because the way she had described this sister to me is that she is older, and married a mexican man so he could get a green card). she goes off on me about how it doesn’t matter who her sister is dating, i try to validate her by telling her i understand and that i was sorry i phrased it the way I did.

"Found out my ex was cheating, months later.","Long story short, my ex gf broke things off with me back around the new year. We had been together for about a year and a half, even lived in the same town(she moved out there to be close to me). It was the classic bllindside text message telling me she was done, virtually no signs things were going badly. She called me the day after and pretty much put all the blame on me for the breakup. I admit I made some mistakes but none of them were terrible and they could've been resolved if she had communicated those at the time. And as soon as our relationship ended, she was seeing someone else.

I was already going through a lot in other aspects in my life, and the sudden ending of what I thought was a stable relationship drove me to one of the darkest places I've ever been to. I'll admit I spiralled emotionally, it left me broken in a way I've never experienced before. Right up to wishing I simply didn't exist to stop the daily pain I felt.

After months of reflection, taking a hard look at myself, and researching things like attachment styles(didn't know anything about them before, I think my ex had a more fearful avoidant attachment style) I'm finally at a place where I feel ""normal"". It's been a journey that on the back end of this I'm almost grateful I went through it.

Recently I found out that she had been actively seeing her new guy since September of last year, months before she ended things with me. It's honestly not surprising. She also told me at the time of the breakup she didn't want to lose me as a friend. We've only had loose contact since that time and she's asked before how I'm doing, acting like she still cares.

Now I'm at a crossroads as far as what I should do. With that knowledge friendship for me is off the table, I'm done. Part of me wants to tell her what I know and cut things off, but another part just wants to go silent and never give an explanation. What would you do in this situation?",2,3,2025-06-29 15:17:38,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnh65d/found_out_my_ex_was_cheating_months_later/,,,"Cut her out of your life permanently. You dont need liars in your circle. If she is capeable of things like these, she probably can do worse than this if it benefits her. ||| I would want to tell her and block her personally. But id give it a week and sit on it and see if you ever even wanna say anything to her anymore. There's really no rush since it's already been a while and she doesn't know you know. But yes personally i would tell her if only because i want her to know she was found out for being a pos. Would probably make her a better person later on as people like that really only have a chance at changing when they get caught. But id also block off everything after i send it. Idk if she has that classic victim complex so many cheaters have, but she would absolutely use it if she was given the opportunity. don't give that to her"
I don't know what I should do,"My GF was ignoring me for like 2 weeks, she didn't wanted to talk with me. One day I got mad and I told her to get out from my house. I didn't knew she went to my friend house (he is male) and I got mad when I found out she was sleeping at his place and we had argument, she said I'm psycho and I overreact that. When she haven't wanted to get back to my house she said that night she is going to her friend (who is female) and I found that she was still sleeping at his place. That thing made me going crazy and I was crying about that whole night, texting her and she told me only that I'm full of complexes young boy and I'm crazy. For the sake of my mental and emotional peace, I knew that I had to break-up. When I texted her (since she didn't want to meet and talk with me) it felt like she just didn't care at all. Next day when she came to my house to take her things and get back to her home, she told me that she thinks that we need a break, 
She said she needs to think things through, that she’s not ruling anything out, but in her opinion I crossed the line — and that she hasn't felt good with me for the past two years, which is why she’s been acting the way she has these past two weeks.
The fact that we work at the same place and we still see each other doesn't help.
I just don't know, I really love her so much but I don't believe in breaks, and the fact that she lied about where is she sleeping, I can't stop thinking about it. ",1,0,2025-06-29 21:14:13,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnpspn/i_dont_know_what_i_should_do/,,,
"Scared they might get with someone new, how to deal with this?","My partner of 7 years broke up with me 2 days ago because the distance was getting in the way, they were tired of the back and forth flights and felt they were neglecting me because their work was too intense. They also didn't see themselves moving to where I live, and in the end added that they didn't love me the way they used to (even though the day before they were saying they loved me too much that saying goodbye was harder each time, and they felt like they were holding me back...).

Long story short : I'm terrified of them getting with someone now.
Whether it'd be a hookup or a relationship.
We were each other's firsts and the idea of him with another woman makes me sick.
I'm thinking of his coworkers and friends of friends I'm sure would jump at the first opportunity...
Also scared his friends might recommend hooking up after getting drunk to get over me...

He said he wasn't interested in a relationship and doesn't have the time anyway but I feel like sometimes men only think with what's down there...

I feel stupid and immature for this but can't help it... how to deal with it?",2,6,2025-06-29 17:22:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnk733/scared_they_might_get_with_someone_new_how_to/,,,"Alright. I hear you. But you gotta come back to solid ground.  You’re spinning stories in your head that haven’t even happened yet. Torturing yourself with pictures you invented. That’s not love. That’s fear. And fear will rot you from the inside out if you let it.  He left. For whatever reason, he chose his path. Doesn’t mean you weren’t worth the effort. Doesn’t mean someone else won’t step up where he stepped out. But right now, you’re stuck in his life instead of living your own.  You're scared of him moving on. Let me tell you something hard. He will eventually. Maybe next week, maybe next year. But you can’t chain your peace to someone else’s zipper. You want dignity? You want strength? Let him go. Fully. Because you sure as hell can’t half-hold on and call it healing.  You were each other’s firsts. That’s a big thing. But that don’t make him your last. And you ain’t stupid for feeling what you feel. But you are in charge of what you do with it.  So take your focus off who might warm his bed next, and put it on building a life so full, so grounded, you don’t give a damn who’s warming anyone’s bed.  Let the fear come. Feel it. Then get back on your feet. You’ve got a life to live, and it ain’t waiting on him or his next mistake."
"Shorter relationship, different pain","I had a relationship that started 6 years ago, we were together for 3y, then we broke up. That breakup was absolutely devastating. We had just moved in together, and she cheated on me. I was wondering why it happened, what happened, what did I do wrong, what should I have done better. All the things. I cried every night for a month. I have never felt so much emotional pain. I had no friends to help, I was alone and sad.

Over the next 3 years though, I made some very close friends, started hanging out with people, and after about 2 years I was pretty much back on it. I still thought about it sometimes, but not in a way that hurt. In hindsight she was mean, toxic, and the love hadn't been there for 6 months. I got better, improved my life, and figured out who I am and what I like.

  
Then earlier this year I met a girl. We sort of hit it off and things were going really well. I was honestly afraid and stressed about having to open up and learn about someone all over again, but she made it easy. We went on a few dates, officially started dating, and I thought it was going really really well! 

Recently she had to travel overseas for work. She got distant, our conversations became brief or one-sided, and when she got back, it was like she’d already emotionally checked out. We had a conversation about it and we cordially decided to break it off after only a few months.

Her reasoning boils down to 1) We just didn't communicate the same way and 2) I just wasn't quite as confident as she wanted. To clarify, I absolutely do not blame her, we left on a very good note and I sort of agree. I think we were willing to work on point 1 but 2 was a deal-breaker for her. She didn't want to hope I would change, and didn't want to ask me to change - which I deeply respect. This relationship was an order of magnitude shorter than the previous one, years compared to months, and I only cried for maybe an hour total. However, this one hurts so much *different* than the first breakup.

I think it hurts so much different because the person she described that she wanted is EXACTLY who I want to be, and there is nobody to blame but myself for that. I think I am a good person, but I have always been non-confrontational and overthink every word I say. I have never liked that about myself though. Her reasoning is perfectly valid, but it hurts so much because I feel like I barely even got to know her and I fucked it up. I feel like I lost my chance at what truly could have been a great relationship because I communicate like a robot, and I boil things up before releasing them - always waiting for the right time that never comes. I instinctively treated everything too seriously - like it was a job sometimes - and I deeply regret that and wish that wasn't who I was.

Now I'm not sure what to do. I want to use this as a catalyst to become that person, but I'm afraid I'm just doing it because that is what SHE wants. I have not liked that about myself for a long time, so I don't think that is the case, but I can't tell. I also would love a second chance in a month, 2 months, 6 months maybe, but that is probably a bad mindset to have (and I'm sure I will grow out of it). And what if I get in another relationship, will they feel the same way? Getting to know me, realizing that is how I am, and leaving?

In the end, I feel like I fucked up something that could have been truly great with an understanding, kind, intelligent person because of a personal flaw that I have always hated with no chance at redemption.

Sort of shouting this into the void just to write it all out and understand it myself. I'm not sad, not mad, just frustrated that I'm not the person I want to be.",1,0,2025-06-29 21:07:33,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnpn3j/shorter_relationship_different_pain/,,6 month(s),
I was thinking about my breakup today.,"It's been 4 months since me and my ex ended the relationship. We were together for 3 years and lived together for pretty much all of it. I believe she had undiagnosed BPD, or at the very least displayed all signs and symptoms of it. I have depression and have most of my life. Mental illness isn't super important here, besides BPD making relationships very intense, along with my depression. The highs are unthinkably high and the lows are absolutely crushing.

I thought by 4 months I would at least be feeling a little better, but it's a different, more deep ache that pulls me down regularly. I have been really struggling this whole month with it and I came up with a metaphor I wonder if other people could relate with. 

I feel like my neurons or synapses and whatnot are no longer powered nor is there anything to process. It's like my favorite restaurant that lost electricity and ran out of produce, ingredients, meat etc with zero orders being shipped to it anymore. All of the equipment is in working order, ready to be used to make amazing meals. It USED to be a great restaurant full of happy customers, great reviews, people making reservations. Now abandoned due to the inability to run. Stuck in time.

I liken it to how I feel, or lack thereof. There's no more humor (happy customers) in my life, no joy (great reviews), no point of them even being a physical presence in my brain (reservations). I know this isn't a perfect metaphor, but it's how I've been feeling a lot lately.

Anyway, I just wanted to type it out and hope anyone else dealing with things like this will get their power and ingredients back some day.

For my ex…. PW from AM,"F(18) M(23)

the truth is I know you could never see this and if you do it's for you PW listen from the beginning it was a beautiful relationship you and I were so different and each one's desire was beautiful we agree on many things and in others I know we don't but we were willing to do it. and when you told me I'm tired of so much shit in my life I want to calm down have something stable and improve I told you let's do it! I helped you change, to improve, to think in a different way! When you went to the hospital I was by your side without letting go and telling you how much I love you! When your sister died I supported you and I listened to you for hours and hours without stopping talking about her and I never said anything when you got cancer and crying you told me if I lose my hair will you love me the same I said yes and I loved you more than ever! When I came home from work and gave you massages! When you were scared and I told you that everything was going to be okay! The times when we talked about our children, about their names and everything we would have done together!

then we get out of all that right? hahaha you beat cancer, you no longer had hair, you didn't feel like doing anything, you had extra weight and I still saw that beautiful princess that made me fall in love! I sent you to buy the rings to ask you to marry me, you saw them in photos without wanting to hahaha and you didn't say anything! and then you started working, only 8 hours in fast food and I work construction and I would still come home and wash the bathroom, fix the room, cook and if not I would send you money every day for food! I would come home and give you massages and fill you with love until one day I wouldn't love you anymore! There was no more time to hear me, you no longer had the energy, hear me and that you didn't want my kisses, my affection, we no longer went out, we no longer spoke and in the end you never told me anything else you were never sincere when crying I asked you please what's wrong tell me and you never said anything to me! Until the day came that I left I got tired of begging you love of asking you and of looking for you and making you happy and I was on the floor!


I asked you one last time before I left if you had something to send me and all you saw was you said no and you started playing xbox! God how it hurt! I'm lost in my life! I feel empty without you I miss you a little less every day I see how you do all these things and you don't pay attention to me not one message or one call or anything and the truth is it hurts but every day I understand that while I gave you everything I swore to you and showed you the love possible in every way you told me that you were doing bad in life and that I wanted to take advantage of your work to improve and be ready for life because at any moment you can fall again and it hurt! Because you could do it with me there! Supporting each other and being the best I'm going to miss you so much I thank you for so many beautiful things and at the same time I hate you! I hope karma makes you pay because you used me and in the end when you didn't want me anymore you just let me go and said you couldn't give me what I wanted and that it was a problem between both of us.

I was never going to be able to change something bad I did or said if you didn't tell me! I wish you the best, but far away from me. While you're already looking for new friends or boyfriends or whatever, I'm suffering here, but rest assured, when it doesn't hurt anymore and I find that person who has always been loving, funny, and eager to be the best, it will be too late for you!

"Seven months after he cheated, he still wants to be friends","I broke it off with him after finding out he was sending sexual and flirty messages to 3 other women. He tried getting me back but I cut him off.

 Then in April he messages me saying he misses me; how i made him laugh and how beautiful i am and wants to hang out sometimes. I said no at first because i still had feelings. It was a horrible feeling, hearing he moved on. I blocked him then unblocked him a week later and he still wanted to be friends. I said why would i be friends with you after what you did.

I’ve got some advice. Cut the damn cord.  He cheated. Lied. Broke your trust. Then had the gall to say you hurt him because you walked away from his mess? That’s not remorse. That’s manipulation. He doesn’t want friendship. He wants access. He wants to keep you close enough to feed his ego, not because he respects you.  You’re not crazy for still feeling something. You’re human. But feelings aren’t a reason to keep poison in your life. And make no mistake, that’s what he is. He didn’t just screw up. He chose to betray you, and now he wants to act like you’re both equally at fault.  Let that sink in.  He had a shot. He blew it. He lost the right to be in your life the moment he started shopping around behind your back. Don't let him use your kindness or confusion as a back door to get in again.  Block him. Leave him there. Heal in peace.  You don’t owe a cheater friendship. You owe yourself a clean break."
broken up but still talking.,"so my long distance ex and i have been on n off for about three years, its been a constant toxic cycle but we can’t seem to let it go fully-we don’t talk for a couple months or its just a relationship with no commitment thing til we get back together.
the distance had been alot for us in trust-even tho its only about an 1hr away from eachother..
anyways we had a huge argument a couple days ago, that involved me drinking and saying disrespectful things (underlying issues that never seemed to be resolved in the relationship) which lead to him not wanting to be together, which is honestly valid and i think its what i subconsciously wanted to but was to scared to say anything. im not sure of anything right now. 
we still are in contact and see eachother here n there, with saying i love you and keeping the routine alive..

i really just can’t wrap my head around the fact i genuinely need to let this connection go for the sake of my mental health. im getting super obsessive knowing that he probably doesn’t feel the same way anymore and most likely will be talking to other people.
i know that i have to leave it behind and move on but im really struggling to block him or find sense of security within myself to do so.
 
i have such an anxious attachment style that it honestly drives people away.

any advice to get over that mental block? ",1,0,2025-06-29 21:05:31,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnplbb/broken_up_but_still_talking/,,,
Tough spot,"Broke up with my gf of 5 years, planned a future with her, spent every single week with her, she broke up with me due to differences / change of feelings or whatever (i’m still confused). 

I’ve tried my hardest to chase her, she’s shut me down every-time. Just apologises and says no. 

I’m split between wanting to chase her (you always hear about stories of people who get back together after multiple tries), but wanting to run away from her (I’m traumatised by how cold she’s become and how quickly she cut me off with very little consideration for my feelings).

I think I insanely miss the idea of her/us, but I’d lose respect for myself if I chase again (I really, really would). 

It’s easy to say “just move on”, but it’s been 4 months since we broke up, and my daily experience of life sucks. I miss her / us so much.

How do I get over this?,"Me and this guy I was dating who I FELL HARD for stopped talking about 2 weeks ago. He promised me great things and pursued me initially. I was reluctant at first because I generally wasn’t looking for love but then I became comfortable with it. We started dating; he told me he told his friends and family about me, that he planned all these dates, he was always thinking about me, he wanted to KNOW me and my circle, that he was only focused on me and saw me as his future. Next I know, he ghosted me. Of course he did. I confronted his absence and he immediately replied saying he was so sorry and that he has a lot of things going on at the moment that he wanted to see me in person to explain. I told him a day I am free.. no response UNTIL that day when I again confronted his silence. He said I deserve better, that infact upon retrospection he wasn’t ready for a relationship because of his insecurities, how I’m not the problem it’s him - all the usual stuff. I immediately told him how heartbroken I was and decided to cut it all off abruptly to his obvious disappointment. I unfollowed (not blocked) him from my socials but he never unfollowed me back. I of course had my grieving process for about a week… 2 weeks after, not even 2 weeks after, about 11 days after he is posting somebody else all lovey-dovey with them. I found out through his absence he was actually going on dates with them etc. the two appear very close and I feel like I was just lovebombed or his second option really.

The same day he asked me to spend my life with him, he had messaged his married best friend saying, “I miss you, want you, but don’t want to hurt you or get you in trouble by getting caught.” She replied, “What if I don’t?” In that moment, I realized their relationship had never been just platonic.

Then came more. One night when I was pregnant, crying, feeling vulnerable and alone, he had gone to have sex with a woman he’d just met on a dating app.

I uncovered a fake Instagram account where he followed countless women, including porn stars, and a Reddit community where he actively offered to have sex with married women while their husbands watched.

My body went numb. My mind spiraled. My soul felt like it had been ripped apart. I couldn’t sleep, I just lay there, staring at the ceiling all night in complete shock.

When the morning came, I pretended to wake up early and head to the gym. The truth was, I couldn’t bear to look at the person I no longer recognized. He left for work, and shortly after, sent him a voice message ending everything.

And then came the most difficult choice of all, the one that broke me completely.

I chose not to have the baby.

He’s reached out since it ended.

In his emails, he says he’s sorry. That everything he did, the lies, the cheating, the secret conversations and hookups, was because he was seeking validation. That it had nothing to do with me, that he was broken and needed attention to feel alive. And maybe there’s some truth in that. But knowing I wasn’t the reason doesn’t take away the pain he caused.

He’s also said the world would be better off without him. That he doesn’t want to live. And hearing that broke something in me again but in a different way. Because no matter how much he hurt me, I don’t want him to disappear. I don’t want anyone to feel that hopeless. Still, I can’t help but feel like even his pain has become something I’m being asked to carry, when I’ve already carried too much.

The part that’s hardest to admit?
I still feel in love.
Even now, even after everything.
It’s not something I’m proud of, it’s just real.

Five years of my life were wrapped up in him. We built a life. We made plans. We shared little routines that felt like home. And yet, the entire time, there was a side of him I never knew. A darkness I didn’t see until it destroyed everything.

I pray that you heal, it won't be easy, but you can do it. He needs serious help, and remember that you're not responsible for his brokenness.

Pangs of sadness during happiness,"I went out drinking and clubbing with my friends since being cheated on. My friends were all so supportive and nice. They were telling me how they missed me and how I’m so much better off without with my ex. 

I was having fun and dancing all night but I started getting pangs of sadness and grief at randoms point throught out the night.

I was proud I never contacted my ex even when drunk. I knew she was out at a club with her sister and I was meant to go to the same club but didn’t once I realised she was there.

Even with all my friends around I felt lonely seeing other couples be happy, dance and showing each other affection.

I did end up drinking more than I expected, I’m guessing it was to numb the pangs of sadness. 

I know a a couple of my friends who weren’t out with us were worried about me incase I felt sad or went to a dark place. These two friends waited up for me to get home safely even after they had finished work. 

I know I have a lot of love and kindness around me but I still feel like I’m lonely to an extent. I constantly try to keep myself busy or speak to people. ",2,1,2025-06-29 16:44:45,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnj95q/pangs_of_sadness_during_happiness/,,,"Good on you for standing your ground and not reaching out to her, that’s real strength. The sadness sneaking in when you’re supposed to be having fun is normal — heartbreak doesn’t quit just because you’re surrounded by friends. Drinking more to dull it won’t fix it either, just delays facing the pain. Loneliness isn’t about being around people, it’s about what’s missing inside. Keep leaning on those friends who got your back, but also give yourself permission to feel it all. Healing takes time, and it’s okay to not be okay sometimes."
I lost the love of my life because his family believed a married man who was secretly in love with me," 
 So I had this very sweet, loving, caring boy. He had the purest, truest love for me. When I touched him, I could feel his heart almost exploding from how fast it was beating.

We were together for 10 months. I had never felt so loved, and I had never loved anyone as much as I loved him.

But his family never accepted us because they’re very religious and we were atheists. So of course they thought I was the one pressuring him to stop being religious (which is obviously not true).

His mother is a typical “boy mom.” She was always paranoid, thinking I would steal her son from her or turn him against his family. She has also been diagnosed with several mental health conditions and is known for making her family’s life a literal hell. She’s very manipulative and have intense breakdowns. Her husband has been trying to divorce her for decades, but she keeps threatening to take her own life if he does 🥲basically trapping him.

Things got even worse when this one old, creepy guy found out we were dating. He knew both of us, but he was in love with me and became extremely possessive (he’s literally married and has kids 😭). He told me that he would do anything to break us up because he couldn’t stand that “a girl as pretty as you would date a guy like him.”

The problem is, this guy is an old friend of my ex’s family. They trust him a lot because he’s seen as a nice man: rich, married, with kids, and supposedly “happy” (💀🤡).

He made their minds against me. He told them I was an opportunist, gold digger, and had bad intentions. I tried warning my ex’s family about him many times, but they never believed me.

It got to the point where this man convinced my ex’s mom to force him to a mental health hospital just to keep him away from me. This ended in a suicide attempt 💔 he was found unconscious and spent days in the hospital, nearly dying.

All of this traumatized him deeply. As much as he loved me, yesterday he told me that he officially doesn’t feel anything for me anymore.

I can’t stop crying 😭😭 Why is life so unfair? 😞 I just want my sweet boy to be happy
I miss him so much, and i know that his family, especially his mom is always going to make him suffer so much because since he was a kid she's been doing crazy stuff that forever traumatizes him 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

Wanted me first/ Then ”not ready”,"

Hi Reddit,

I’m 23M, and I’ve been involved in a very emotionally confusing situationship for over 2 years with a 25F. We had deep emotional conversations, shared intimacy, and even talked about a future together — including a trip this summer. She once said I was the complete opposite of her toxic ex, and that I made her feel safe

Then about a month ago, she suddenly texted me saying she wasn’t ready for anything serious and wanted to “just be friends” after we got closer for the first time in 7 months I replied with honesty — that I had stronger feelings than that — and then gave her space for a week.

But instead of drifting apart, we ended up reconnecting shortly after. We slept together, and she told me she felt more comfortable with me now than ever. Talked about future things and  Then the day after i got ignored when i saw her out, i got a little bit hurt and told her i just wanted respect and she kissed me but went away after that, the day after she Said ”contact can become problematic”

One weekend later, I saw her out. I kept my distance. She came to me said things like ”i care about you”, then when i was going to ask her a simple ting she acted like she didnt hear me and i asked her about why she does that and gave her the mirror about things in the past but in a calm way.  she completely stonewalled me — no reaction, no words, nothing. Like I didn’t exist. It was emotionally brutal, because this came after intimacy, connection, and months of consistency and care from my side.

And I recently learned she cheated on her ex before this one (something she always claimed was unforgivable in others). That hit hard.

She used to say things like:
	•	“I’m not a good girl.”
	•	“It’s scary when someone sees through me.”
	•	“You should be more nonchalant.”

And even said “I would die if I saw you with another girl.”

I’ve never mirrored her coldness. I’ve stayed respectful and present. But I’m left wondering:
Was this a fearful avoidant cycle? A trauma reaction? Something deeper?
Or was I just a placeholder?
(Her ex has absued her before and she says thats the reason she is lost right now and stuff like that. They broke up 3 years ago but she went back to him a couple of months after i didnt Commit to her because of moving to another country and he did the same thing so they broke up again maybe 4 months ago and i moved back here)",1,0,2025-06-29 20:18:06,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnoggh/wanted_me_first_then_not_ready/,,,
"Did I walk away too soon? (30M & 27F — strong connection, fast emotions, and a complicated past)","I (30M) recently started seeing a woman (27F), and the connection between us was strong from the start. We didn’t sleep together — just made out a few times — but the emotional side moved quickly. She’s a single mom, and her son means the world to her. She’s also shared that she’s had a rough past, including a phase where she was struggling with alcohol and made some decisions she regrets — including sleeping with a lot of people.

She was very open about all of this, almost too soon. She told me I was the calmest and most respectful guy she’s ever talked to — that I stood out because I didn’t pressure her for sex like other guys did. I appreciated that and felt something real, but her oversharing about her past — especially sexual experiences and how many people she’d been with — made it hard for me not to overthink. It wasn’t about judging her, it was just too much, too soon, and I wish we had built a foundation first.

There was this one moment that stuck with me — we were in Cambria, sitting in my truck listening to 80s music, and she knew every song, including a Billy Joel one that really meant something to me. She held my hand, looked at me with that calm sweetness, and I felt so comfortable and seen. The way she talks to her son — so gently, so lovingly — made me think, “She’d be a great mom.”

But despite all that, I backed away. She formed a deep emotional attachment fast, and I wasn’t sure I was ready. I also got uncomfortable with how some people from her past were still in her life — like a guy she used to be with who still checks in on her. She says it’s nothing and that he once helped her through a dark time, but it still made me uneasy. I never said anything harsh — I just started feeling overwhelmed and eventually told her maybe we weren’t ready for each other.

Now that some time has passed, I can’t stop thinking about whether I was too quick to pull away. She already unblocked me on Facebook, but hasn’t said anything. I’ve been debating if I should reach out once — not just to get closure, but maybe to offer friendship, or to let her know I’d be open to giving it another shot if she ever wanted to — slowly, with better communication and mutual respect.

I should mention that I also feel embarrassed because I told a couple of cousins about the breakup, and I explained some of the reasons like her emotional struggles and maturity. Now I feel a little shame if I were to reconnect — like I’d be judged for going back on my word.

So Reddit, I’d really appreciate some honest input:
Did I walk away too soon? Or did I do the right thing by stepping back when I felt overwhelmed? Would it be okay to send one honest message for closure or the possibility of a second chance — or should I just let it be?

Thanks for reading.

Last words were full of hate,"When she and I finally broke up I find out all the things I told her were appreciated and I was thankful for was nothing but a burden, convinced when she left my animals would die and my house would be a mess, that I wouldn’t take care of anything.

Did I make a mistake breaking up with my ex of 7 years? I can’t stop thinking about him.,"It’s been a year since I ended a 7-year relationship, and I still can’t shake the feeling that I may have made a mistake. I was going through a lot mentally at the time and thought breaking up would give me space to heal and grow. But now I’m starting to question if I walked away from something rare and meaningful. For reference I’m (F23) and he’s (M24). So we were together since teenagers.

My ex is someone I deeply cared for. He had all the qualities I admire—driven, loyal, hardworking. He’s a college graduate with a master’s in finance, a minor in history, and he owns a home that he currently rents out—he’s literally a landlord at our age. He’s been working since he was 14, is a car guy with multiple vehicles (a truck, a motorcycle, a couple mopeds), and overall just had his life together. He came from a loving two-parent household, which showed in how grounded and respectful he was. He would fly me out for my birthday, surprise me with expensive gifts, and he had a genuinely good heart.

But I didn’t leave without reason. As close as we were, it started to feel more like a friendship or roommate dynamic than a romantic relationship. We rarely went on dates. I wasn’t always sexually fulfilled or emotionally pursued in the way I needed. I craved deeper intimacy, more consistent effort in affection and romance. And truthfully, I wasn’t in a good mental space either. I was overwhelmed and felt like I was losing myself, so I thought taking space was the only way to figure out who I was becoming.

Since then, I’ve tried dating and talking to new people, but nothing feels the same. I get turned off quickly. Most men I meet now seem lazy, unmotivated, emotionally unavailable, or just looking for sex. I want a provider—someone who sees me as a future wife, not just a placeholder. The truth is, I still can’t picture having a family with anyone but my ex. I haven’t been able to feel that deep level of comfort and safety with anyone else.

One thing this year of being single has taught me is that when people say, “enjoy your twenties, party, be free”—it’s not always fulfilling. I’ve experienced that lifestyle, and it honestly feels hollow. If you’re fortunate enough to find your person early on, someone with real values who wants to build a life with you—don’t throw that away too fast. Your twenties aren’t just for partying. They’re for laying the foundation for your future. Personally, my goal has always been marriage, kids, and generational wealth. I want to build stability now, not wait until I’m burnt out or jaded later in life.

So now I’m left wondering:
Did I make the wrong decision by leaving someone who truly cared for me?
Should I even be dating right now—or should I stay single and focus on healing and continuing to work on myself first?

Maybe test the waters and see if he wants to meet in person and chat over coffee and see where things are at.

You complained that your ex wasn't putting in more consistent effort or making you feel good but there is zero mention of what you did for him or how he benefited in any way.

7month after breakup - yearner,"So i just finished my 1 week vacation  where i mostly yearned about my last relationship that ended just a week after new year.

It was mostly my fault: i wasn't mature enough to confront her about what was going wrong and wasnt motivated enough to get her back when she left with a breakup text 

So this week..with no work to do and nothing planned i had my mind going crazy ..i couldnt even run much (my new hobby) cause i started getting shin splints...

  
So today.. instead of crying and journaling my empty week i started writing this

  
""I wanna see you again

Im craving for the day  
Ill see YOU again

Looking at each other  
Sharing no words

With grins   
Hinting  at the past

That tries to surface  
To slip out from our eyes

BUt This time  
We won’t let them fall

we notice  
We understand   
We feel how those drops

Are all connected  
And we stay there

Until they cling to our lashes

So we again  
See each other

See love  
And smile

As we dry each others tears  
Knowing it never ended""

Funny thing is that 3 hours later..after a 5km jog with my friend ...she passed by me  
smiling with probably his new dude

We never contacted each othe  ..even on our birthdays ..but this would be so interesting to send 

..so i ended it with this   


Irony  
Just so you  
Not YOU  
But the real version of you

Im happy I could see u smile  
Even if it was for another person



  
I obviously cried a little bit when i walked home but...  
thanks god for letting me know theres no way back

I reached out to him.,"I was with my partner for 5 years before he became distant and ended our relationship.

I was left confused by his words, but hopeful that we could reconcile and try again in the future.

Hope (delusion) left me holding onto him, holding on to the idea that he would come back. It stopped me from fully letting go, and accepting that it was really over.

After some healing, I decided to reach out and apologise for the mistakes I made during our relationship.

I let him know that if there was any part of him that questioned his decision, I would be open to talk about it. 

That’s when he told me there was no chance he would change his mind, and that I needed to let go of the idea.

It was a blunt response, but one that couldn’t be misinterpreted. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but it was what I needed to hear.

I can now fully let go of him, knowing that I did everything I could to try and save our relationship. I know that I would’ve regretted not reaching out otherwise.

Although things didn’t work out the way I wanted, I’m glad I now have the closure I need to move on.",2,6,2025-06-29 20:10:11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lno9la/i_reached_out_to_him/,,5 year(s),"how does it feel now after the closure? i never got the closure really , i made one for myself ,i have forgotten about her now but still some times , it feels so damn different ||| To be honest they do regret and if it’s men they do come back when you’ve moved on"

Out of Nowhere Break Up,"I (30’s M) was broken up with by my girlfriend (30 F) out of what felt like absolutely nowhere and although we were together just two months it feels so utterly confusing. 

I have had long term relationships, but this was the first relationship I have ever had where it felt perfect from the start and I felt like she wanted to be with me so much I was almost taken aback. She made me feel seen and desired and kept reciprocating how great it was all feeling to me. Did things like wrote me letters, sent me postcards, made me little gifts, told me how special I was. Then kind of out of nowhere she broke up with me.

We had like two disagreements that weren’t even fundamental to who we are, just things that anyone should talk about and she just bailed. She said it was because of a “gut feeling” but when she broke up with me it felt like she threw the kitchen sink at me for reasons to break up. She said we were incompatible, we weren’t sexually compatible, I didn’t increase her zest for life, I was not positive enough, our sense of humors didn’t align, she didn’t feel the spark, the idea of moving in together in a year didn’t fill her with joy, what if she wanted to pick up and travel the world for two years? 

Like every reason under the sun and I was like “wow it sounds like you really really don’t want to be with me.” 

And she was like “I didn’t come here to break up with you. I’m not sure how I feel.”

And I was like “ummm I think you have listed every reason under the sun people break up.”

And she asked “What if I change my mind in a week?” And said things like “I’m probably gonna go home and cry a lot about this”

And I was just like trying for two hours to suss out what was going on and then she said her gut was telling her not to be with me. And I said “Okay… Bye then” and she asked me for a hug and I was like “what?? No.”

It was so unbelievably random and out of nowhere and made me feel so embarrassed how quickly I had developed feelings for her. Wtf was that? It was absolute whiplash. Does anyone know what this kind of thing is? Like how someone can completely turn on a dime? I just want some kind of closure because it was deeply unsettling how epic the flip was.

I never needed to hear anything more than these words…,"My ex texted me…..

It’s completely understandable why they feel that way but damn. I thought we were friends. I thought they cared about me. Maybe even loved me? Haha. What a fucking joke. All of it was. 

That cut deep, but I remind myself that I  needed to hear it and I won’t ever forget it or how it made me feel. 

Counting down the days until I no longer have to see or talk to this person anymore (we work together) or all the other people that set my life and me on fire while claiming to love and care about me.

I’m reeling and I’m so hurt but I know it was the final nail and it’s what I needed to hear today.   I’m counting down the days and weeks until I am free and I’m not a part of any of this anymore. ||| Also, I need to focus on my life and rebuilding.   I don’t want a relationship based on lies and deceit. I’m so blindsided and stupidly hurt. I have to walk through this alone and get anything I bring up or any betrayal turned around me like it’s my fault?  I didn’t know! I didn’t lie.   While I was in both my adult relationships, I didn’t know what happened behind my back. That isn’t my fault. If I wasn’t cut completely open here and dying, I’d wouldn’t even fucking bother. I know changes in my work life are coming and needed.   The opportunity for peace and genuine love still awaits me. As completely heartbroken as I am, I need to take a step back and look at this through my future lens.   I just need to push through the next little bit. I have never been tested like this in my entire life.   I want to make it to a safe, loving and warm place. Where my heart is simply…. loved, accepted, celebrated, cherished, protected…… and entirely away from everything that has maimed it in the past 6 years. The past 6 months! Changes are coming. There is a light. There is hope. One day at a time. I didn’t deserve it.  I’ll keep my head completely down and get to the point I need to. Even though the hurt, betrayal, and everything else fucking guts me! Truly a survival test ||| Honestly, I needed to be discarded to the point of where they said it for themselves.   “You’re just an ex girlfriend, what happens after a relationship isn’t the other person’s business”  I wish understood that lesson 8 months ago. If that’s a statement only to negate their contribution to the absolute cluster fuck that is imploding, who knows? None the less, some words stay with you forever and give you clarity. I would have loved to know  it then, but at least  I know it now and that’s better than nothing! Regardless of how many months it took me to catch up. I did! It doesn’t change anything and I don’t need to walk around with this hurt or trauma after I release it. It’s on to an entirely new life that I have more than earned. Somebody is going to reep the benefits of “me” and I can’t wait to find that person!!!"

But very immature way to communicate for sure ||| Same thing happened to me with an ex of mine. I broke up with him after 2.5 years together, because his BPD would bring about periods of abuse, and he wasn't looking for professional help.   He seemed rather unborhored at first; then exactly 6 months later, started messaging me just to insult me, would send me demeaning reels and voice messages (nothing too agressive, but it was stuff like ""I'm sitting on the toilet, and it made me think of you, greetings"", lol..

"Did I lose someone who loved me, or someone who couldn’t love?","I supported her in every possible way — emotionally, logistically, lovingly — and tried to be there through her struggles, including ongoing family issues and what seemed like unresolved trauma.

But over time, she grew more distant. She didn’t hold space for my world or show real curiosity about my past or who I am. While I did everything for her, she often felt absent emotionally, and decisions felt one-sided.

Eventually, I voiced needing more balance and collaboration — just emotional partnership. Her response was cold and guarded. That conversation turned into a breakup, but looking back, I feel like she led me there because she brought up all kinds of excuses for how we wouldn't work. I initiated the breakup, but tried to repair things shortly after. She refused, saying she “can’t trust me,” even though I had done everything I could to show consistency and love.

Since then, she has deleted all our photos, made her social media more curated (even added back an ex), and ignored my one follow-up message (which was kind and not pushy).

My girlfriend (19F) of a year and a half cheated on me(20M) with a guy from her class. Should I break up wit her?,"Some backstory: With her we have been together for almost an year and a half. This is the first relationship we are both virgins. Everything was going amazing at the start. After a couple of months, we became intimate but never had sex. In the past couple of months, we have been having problems. It was not going so well. I stopped initiating any intimacy, kisses, hugs. When she did I wasn’t backing down, but as I said I didn’t initiate them.

Usually, we text each other good morning and good night. She does it more than me and in the last week she was almost aways the one saying This Saturday I saw she didn’t text anything. (I know it is childish) I decided to not do it either. We went on like this for a week. After that we had a talk about breaking up, but I told her that we can try and work it out. Her main concern was that I was not showing enough affection towards her, which I understand. And immediately after I tried was more affectionate, but I felt something was off. Several days after our talk, she told me she cheated on me during these days we didn’t talk. I was in disbelief. She is one of the nicest, kindest people I know and she is also religious so I would never expect sth like this from her. Here is what happened: One of her classmates grabbed her for the ass, she didn’t do anything to stop him, then kissed her and she didn’t stop him again even made out. She told me she was feeling very low during this time. After I continually asked her for details, she finally told me that they even went to her place. They made out some more pleasured each other and that was it. I am so shocked right now. She apologized to me, she told me she was an awful person and regrets it and says she would never do it again. I cant really trust her at all. Also she said that her feeling low was no excuse. So I have to decide right now. Do I break up with her or not? The problem is I still love her, but I also don’t want to be the biggest loser on earth who gets cheated on and just forgets it. She says she would never do it again, but I don’t really trust that right now. After I first the first part where they kissed I was more likely to forgive, but when I heard the second part I am very disappointed. What do you think I should do? If you need anymore information let me know! I need advice badly. Thank you for reading this!

"I (f19) broke 4 months of no contact with my ex (genderfluid 19) to stand up for myself—and I thought it would help, but I just feel worse","Four months ago, I went no contact with someone who emotionally manipulated me. It wasn’t a long relationship only a month, but it wrecked me. They were my first everything—date, kiss, love, sex I was brand new to dating, freshly out the closet as a lesbian. Figuring out who I was, and I fell hard. Because I’m an admitted lover girl. They took advantage of my kindness and inexperience. They made me feel so  wanted, special, chosen. 

But I wasn’t really chosen. I was just the side piece—someone they kept around while chasing someone else. They tried to leave me twice, and I begged them to stay. That’s the part that still makes me ache. I gave so much of myself to someone who never had any intention of loving me back. I ruined myself a million little times for them. So much so that when I look back. I don’t recognize the foolish girl that I acted like around them. I only left when I asked them to commit and they couldn’t. Wouldn’t. 

The last time we spoke before this they asked me to talk. About what I’ll never know. Not like I really want to now anyways. I’m pretty certain what it was. Perhaps to lie through their teeth and lovebomb me again. They claimed they missed me. I doubt it I bet they only missed the endless blind affection I gave them. When I was so blindly infatuated with them. Even when they hurt me so badly and I never had the courage to speak up until i dumped them. I told them I knew I was just their side piece and to never contact me again and blocked them. I tattled on them to their boyfriend for cheating. 

And then they moved on like it meant nothing. Like I meant nothing.

For four months, I stayed silent. I grieved. I journaled. I went to therapy. I started to feel like me and recognize myself again—lighter, clearer, no longer consumed by them. Everyone around me said I seemed like I was back to my old cheerful self again. I thought I was finally healed. But something inside me still needed to speak. Not for attention, not to reopen anything—just to finally say what I couldn’t say when I was still bleeding.

So I followed them briefly—just long enough to send this:

“Hey.
You asked why I followed you again.
Truth is, I did it to prove to myself I’m not scared of you anymore. That you don’t have a hold on me like you used to. I can face the pain you caused without falling apart. I can say what you did hurt me—and not be afraid to admit it.
The girl I was with you? That wasn’t me. That was someone shrinking herself to fit into the tiny space you made for her. Someone who ruined herself a million little times just to feel wanted by you.
You made me feel special, then discarded me like I meant nothing.
So no, I don’t want you back. I’m just closing a chapter that haunted me for months.
I’ve cried, screamed, journaled, healed, and grown. And the girl you knew? She’s gone. She was never real.
This is me now.
Unapologetic. Unafraid. Done.”

They replied with this:

“Don’t really know what to say. But bear with me. Listen, I’ve fucked up a lot in my life. I just turned 19. Starting a new chapter in my life. I’m rewriting my book. You were never supposed to fit into the narrative. I was also trying to find myself during the time ‘we had.’ But we only knew each other for two weeks. I regret some things I did. You’re a good person. And I’m trying to be one. I’ve moved on. And did a long time ago. I’ve got a lot going for me. And I hope you do too. I wish you best in life. This is me now. I’m not the same insecure, depressed, immature person you met. Goodbye.”

It was cold. Detached. Minimizing. Like they were erasing everything. So I sent one final message:

“It wasn’t two weeks — it was a whole fucking month, and don’t insult my intelligence by pretending otherwise.
If rewriting the timeline helps you and your boyfriend sleep better at night, go ahead and live your fantasy. But don’t drag me into your delusions.
I remember every hesitation, every half-truth, every time you pulled away and acted like it was nothing.
You were a coward who couldn’t handle real love, so you made me feel like I was asking for too much when all I wanted was honesty.
Rewrite your story all you want — I’m living in reality now.
And you? You’re not even a footnote anymore.”

Then I blocked them. Fully. For good. I don’t care to hear their bs anymore. 

And now? Even though I know I did the right thing—even though I’m not that broken girl anymore—I still feel awful. Sad. Angry. Shaky. I thought standing up for myself would make me feel free. I thought it would help me move forward. But right now, it just feels like I opened a wound that was finally a healed scar.

Healing isn’t linear. I know that. But this hurts. Badly.

If you’ve ever broken no contact to say what needed to be said, and it still shattered you—how did you deal with the aftermath? I’m proud I spoke up. But I won’t lie: this made everything hurt again.

I saw my ex in public. Did I do the right thing?,"I need some advice because I dunno if I did the right thing

I live in a neighborhood that has this lake that I like to visit when I’m feeling emotional, and I think I saw my ex’s car parked there.. She lives like 30 mins away from here and its away from any major freeways and its like a 30 minute walk from my house (a 2 min. Drive basically).. it’s a somewhat popular place to visit and is beautiful during sunsets so I can see why she would be here.. we cut ties today, I wished her well and I went into no contact..

I think she saw me as I got out of my car though.. so against my better judgement, I sent her a text letting her know that I wasn’t being a weirdo and that this spot helps me emotionally plus its just down the street from my house..

Haven’t got a response so I hope she doesn’t feel weirded out..

I probably shoulda just left and went home, but I feel somewhat entitled to this place since its literally just down the street in my neighborhood and she lives sooo far away and I just wanted to cry somewhere that wasn’t my dark room",0,3,2025-06-29 19:35:19,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnnfim/i_saw_my_ex_in_public_did_i_do_the_right_thing/,,,"Ok. It was very likely a coincidence that you seen her at the lake.  She should be smart enough to know you have moved on as with her. If you see her again. Simply walk away and carry on your business unless she did stop to have a talk. ||| Truthfully she’s probably more embarrassed that you saw her at the lake. Considering just how close it is to your home, most would assume SHE was the one stalking you in your neighborhood. Coming from a girl, her lack of a response may just be a result of embarrassment or confusion as to what to even do in this scenario. Truthfully, I would let it go. You saw her? So what?

I almost gave up on my dreams for him. Now I need to leave,"I know that I need to take responsibility for myself but the rage I feel for my current parent is building up in a way that makes it hard to be present. 
For a year I had to cook, clean, grocery shop and take care of him because he didn't have a job and spent most of his days either playing games,looking for jobs or depressed.

 Now he got a job which pays well and I moved with him. I think I fawned so much that I forgot myself in the chaos and now I feel a deep rooted anger towards him. 
I'm dissatisfied and I feel isolated. I cant leave right now because I need money. All I had went for this move. 
He is not an evil but I feel like I've slowly been guided towards a life I don't want and I'm trying my best to understand how I can get out of this and back to where I belong. 
This is my first relationship and it truly is a big lesson on how I work as a person and I am dreading how breaking up will make him feel. 
I feel nothing when we're intimate and I am extremely sexually unsatisfied because I'm falling out of love. 
I need to collect courage, money and protect my energy, but I truly wish I thought things through. 
Nothing is doomed, but I need to think smartly.

But some of that anger is due to your brain trying to protect you from looking inward. Because deep down you are angry at yourself for everything that you put into the relationship. I think once you can forgive yourself, it will be easier for you to leave the relationship.  Anyway, the plan is pretty simple: save money, set up a support system (friends/family), then leave. It would also help both of you if you started limiting the amount of sexual activity. If you continue to have sex when you don't want it, it can desensitize you and cause serious trauma to your psyche."

Please help me name this?!,"Can we ever be close again? Friends?
All of this can’t have been for nothing
Maybe I’m the reason for your pain 
Everything in me hurts, I miss you
Running away won’t help me
Only you understand how I feel
Not knowing how you are is agony 
I hope you’re better than me
Love should trump all 
Oh how I wish that were true 
Very few things will ever be the same without you 
Even sleep is hard to achieve 
You were safety, you were calm
Over time may we find each other?
Unveil the love once more?
If this cannot be, just know for me
My heart aches at the hurt I caused
Sobbing over many regrets 
Oh how proud of you I am 
Really afraid of the future alone
Right here if I’m needed
You are everything, I’m defeated. 


Please don’t be mean about anything I’m going through an extremely hard time right now. For context this is the first poem I’ve ever written, if you even want to call it that. My boyfriend well ex boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me a couple days ago and I am really not coping very well. I haven’t been able to eat anything that stays down in 54 hours. But I have found that writing the way I feel down in my notes has helped, so I thought writing something that expresses how sorry I am might also do me some good. I feel awful that he felt so unhappy he needed to end the relationship, he said he still loves me and he WANTS us to work but he can’t keep trying and he just doesn’t think we will work anymore. Nothing distinct happened that would cause a break up as even he said that he wanted to end on good terms rather than through an argument. He said that there was just a pattern of us arguing and then being good and he just couldn’t shake the feeling that things would just get bad again. And it was affecting his mental health. So you can see how confused and broken I am feeling. I usually would never do this but I am really struggling and need all the support I can get. No hate about him tho please he genuinely did nothing wrong and he treated me like an absolute queen. I’m just missing him and trying to find new ways to cope.

I feel so sad, so low, sometimes feel nothing. I’ve gotten a lot better but I find myself in a different spot. I know sometimes after breakups you still yearn for that person, it’s the familiarity. Their touch, their smell, their laugh, their voice. I guess I find myself somewhere else now? I yearn to feel loved in the way that I realize I should have been, but not by him.

I dont know what to do!!!,"I started dating a girl in December 2024. We clicked instantly, our personalities matched, we vibed perfectly. She lives like 1 hour drive from me. Her parents loved me and they have told her that I was a much much better person than her ex. She has a history of depression and anxiety. A couple of months passed by, in May 2025 she found a new job with a better salary which meant longer hours and less time for the both us. On that month, out of the blue without any signs she told me that she no longer wanted us to be dating anymore, she said that she didn't feel well mentally and that because of the new job we wouldn't have much time for each other, she said that she didn't want anyone in her life, and that she wanted to feel independent but I disagreed and that we could work things out but she was firm in her decision. I was sad, angry, I cried but I still loved her,  I acted irrationally and removed her from all social media platforms.  A couple of days passed by, I couldn't hold myself so I added her back and wrote to her, she called me afterwards and she wanted to go back dating so I gave it a second chance. Fast forward a month, June, everything went well we were in love with each other or as I thought. We were planning things to do, trips and activities we were happy or as I thought. End of June, again out of the blue, she wanted to end things this time she told me that her feelings are cold and she didn't feel anything anymore. I asked her what about all the ""I love you baby"" and ""you telling everybody that I was your boyfriend"" she told me ""fake till you make it"" and that hurt me a lot. She told that she didn't want anyone in her life, and she wanted to feel independent. The exact same words as the first time but this time she removed me from social media platforms not me.

Struggling to make it through,"I met someone in 2022 who was and still is married. He started the divorce process and I knew it was going to be lengthy.

Things where good for us, we had chemistry. Some time in June of 2023 he began to go hot and cold on me for no reason. I struggled with him detaching then coming back full throttle. In 2024 again the cycle continued … this time he had blocked me on all socials but still coming around and allowing me to do activities with his kids. Fast forward Nov 2024 he started again distancing himself. I figured out he was talking to multiple women.

The day before my birthday he sent me a message completely cutting me off. I respected it but now I knew he was seeing someone else and he was just being a coward and couldn’t be honest with me.

Out of anger I sent him a text telling him I was done with his bullshit and he wasn’t allowed to ever contact me again a few days late he showed up at my house wanting to take me out. I went. 

AGAIN after another month of hot and cold behavior, I started to feel all sorts of unpleasant feelings. I was being used for sex & as a pass time. 

I sent him a lengthy message saying I wasn’t dealing with this again. And he never responded a few days later he response “I’m sorry” with some tragic news I was heartbroken for him I checked in every day with him for the next week or so but he never attempted to check on me.

I stopped checking in I stopped messaging first and I never heard from him again I waited a month … after a month I blocked him it’s been over two months since I’ve seen him over a month since I’ve talked to him.

First-ever breakup at 33,"My 4-year relationship is ending and it’s the first relationship I’ve ever had. I never knew breakups were this painful. 

There’s no anger. No resentment. No hatred. We just grew apart and the connection deteriorated. We still love each other deeply as friends and that almost makes it hurt more… not being able to use anger to write him off. Just having to accept that we gave it a good go and it didn’t work out. It’s the feeling of mourning the loss of a loved one, except its mourning the loss of a future I’d imagined with him.

I still care about him. I worry for him. I want the absolute best for him. And while this is so very painful for me, it breaks my heart even more seeing him in the same pain. 

After roughly 3 years of living together, he’s moving out on his own today. It’s impossible to even imagine him no longer being here.

It starts with ""Heart of Ash"" - that feeling when you're burned by people's cruelty and think love might save you, only to get burned again. It moves through the intoxication phase, the realization, the grief, and finally acceptance.

Writing these helped me understand that some people are meant to be admired, not held. That you can be grateful for someone being part of your story while still needing to let them go.

For anyone else in the thick of healing - you're not alone in feeling ""too much.""

"A quiet goodbye to someone who never asked for my heart, but had it anyway","Just leaving this here for a goodbye I never got to say.

We weren’t in a relationship, just something steady for a while, but my feelings still ran deep. He stopped replying, and maybe that was the answer. Still, I needed to let this out somewhere.

Here’s the poem I wrote instead of sending a message:

Paper Boats


🔸️
Where do paper boats go

After they have sailed?

Do they end up somewhere

To be found

Or do they fade away?


🔸️
Will they get to see

Another sunrise and

Bask in warmth

Or will they drift off

Into the misty sunset?


🔸️
I hoped for the boat

Of possibilities

Between you and me

To always fight the currents

To never vanish from sight


🔸️
But if it should shipwreck

I’m ready to save what’s left

Even with broken pieces

There’s always hope

To hold on to


🔸️
What if it’s forever lost?

I should have made my peace

But the thing is

All I did was cherish it

While it was there


🔸️
Even though

It has run its course

The spark will sail

In my heart

For a long time

I’m feeling stuck and emotionally down in my relationship. Am I asking for too much?,"
I 27 F have been in a relationship for 9 months with a man 27 M I’m feeling stuck and emotionally worn down in my relationship. Am I asking for too much? from a different nationality. In the mid stage of the relationship, I stayed with him and his mom for about 2 months while I searched for a better apartment. He was supportive during that time, and I appreciated it. I’ve since moved into my own place.

He still visits a few times a week, stays over for a night or two, and then goes home. Every time he leaves, I feel empty and emotionally disconnected. I’ve realized that I want more than just a part-time relationship I want marriage, kids, and a stable, shared life. When I brought up the idea of living together, he said I have “expectations” he can’t meet, like wanting a partner with a degree or a better job (which I  said when we started the relationship) He also said he doesn't want me to carry the financial burden, even though I offered to split expenses.

What hurts more is how he treats me sometimes. He often corrects me telling me how to walk, eat, or do things as if I don’t know how. It feels condescending, like I’m being treated as someone incapable or unintelligent. When I try to explain how something he said hurt me, he later mimics my emotional response in a totally different situation.

He’s not intentionally cruel—he brings me  treats, spends money (I spend too) helped me move, and seems to care—but most of his time with me is either spent in intimacy or on his computer. There's very little emotional or future-focused conversation. I feel like we connect only physically. There’s no depth or meaningful talk—almost like a teenage relationship where feelings are there, but nothing is really built.

Meanwhile, I’ve been living independently for years. I manage my own life, home, and responsibilities. He still relies on his mom for cooking and laundry. I often feel like I’m in a strange role—doing the emotional labor and still being treated like I’m the one who’s clueless.

I’m not sure if this is just a temporary mismatch or a deeper incompatibility. I care for him, but I feel like I’m the only one thinking about long-term stability. I feel alone, confused, and unsure about the path forward. 


Am I expecting too much, or is this relationship not truly meeting my needs?",1,0,2025-06-29 19:08:12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnms1i/im_feeling_stuck_and_emotionally_down_in_my/,,9 month(s),
"25F 27M He finally said yes to a relationship, but I'm scared to take the risk. Need advice.","I am 25F, he is 27M. For context, we're both muslims and we had agreed on the first date itself that we're only looking to marry. And i had told him to talk to my parents after about three to six months of knowing each other. And he had agreed. 
And now fast forward to right now, we’ve been in each other’s lives for nearly a year. It's been a cycle of talking, blocking, misunderstandings, and a lot of mixed signals from both sides. But we somehow keep returning to each orher. Recently , I’ve been under family pressure to get married, and he’s been clear that while he likes me, his career isn't stable yet and his family won’t agree to an engagement, only direct marriage, which he isn’t ready for right now. 

He’s always said he respects me and isn’t talking to other girls. I believe him. Recently, I asked him if we're officially dating and he said yes. He seemed genuine, even brought up wanting to build something slow and steady. 

But I panicked. The pressure from my family,my own spiritual guilt about the relationship not being halal yet… it all overwhelmed me. I ended up telling him to talk to my parents within days, even though we had just agreed to take things slow. He called it unfair and that I went back on my word. And then I ended up blocking him again. 

I feel like I sabotaged something that could’ve had potential but I’m also scared I was gonna be stuck in the same loop of me wanting to marry and him not being ready. Plus, technically he knew what i wanted from day 1, he knows my parents might get me married to someone else soon, and he still refuses to step up.
What to do? 

TL;DR:

We finally agreed to date officially after a year of ups and downs. I got overwhelmed by family pressure and told him to bring a rishta soon, even though we had just decided to take it slow. Then i blocked him. I don’t know if I ruined something good or dodged something that was never going to work.

Confused and looking for advice!,"I met a guy a few months ago and he seemed so wonderful. I have met a lot of boys, not men and he seemed like a real man. He truly said and did everything right. He attends a military academy near me. We met, went on a few dates and he asked me to be his girlfriend. Then he had to leave for 3 weeks for summer training. We talked and called almost every day and had such great conversations. He came back last week. While he was gone he randomly told me he feels some strange pull away from me. The next day he called me and told me how sorry he was. And that he has a pattern of running away from the things that are good for him because he is scared about having to maintain them and commit. Like for example he got recruited to join the swim team at his academy. But he decided not to because he was scared of the commitment being the best entailed. I reassured him and everything seemed fine. When he came back we spent 3 lovely days together. They were so great. He was smiling, kissing me, telling me how I was unlike all the women he has met etc. He wrote me love poems. Told me about all these events he wanted to go to with me this year. He even gave me a teddy bear dressed in uniform that he sprayed with his cologne. But he told me that again he saw a future with me and that scared him and he still feels the pulling away feeling. I was so supposed to go to a wedding with him and meet his family this week. He was so excited for it. Well he found out he unexpectedly had to leave for 3 weeks and was upset. I saw him before he left and he cried and hugged me and kissed me and told me I was amazing, and how much he was going to miss me and to wait right here for him. I get a call from him 2 days later with him crying on the phone. He told me he has to break up with me because he feels very physical attracted to me but no romantic intensity. He told me he doesn’t like anything about me besides the boxes I check. Which was so cold out of nowhere. Mind you at this point we have only met and been on 8 dates and he has been gone 3/4 weeks we dated. That is not enough time to learn favorite foods much less have romantic intensity. We are also Christian so we are waiting for marriage. It was only a month but I was very hurt in my last relationship. And I keep wondering what I did wrong. He said he wants to be friends and I told him I would reach out when I feel ready. What do you guys think happened? Just one week ago everything seemed perfect! It was the biggest emotional whiplash. Should I be friends with him and how long should I wait to reach out?

Set Me Free,"
I thought I would be stronger.
I really did.
I told myself that after all this time—
three years of silence, of distance, of aching—
that the weight would lift.
That I’d breathe easier.
That I’d be okay.

But tonight…
I saw her story.
She’s engaged.
And in that moment,
my heart felt like it was tearing its way out of my chest.

I couldn’t breathe.
I couldn’t think.
I just… broke.

I thought I had more strength than this.
I thought I had healed.
But the truth is—I still love her.
Deeply. Helplessly.
I knew this day would come.
I knew someone else would call her “mine.”
But nothing prepared me for how it would feel.
Nothing prepared me for this wave of pain
that hit like it was day one all over again.

Why does it still hurt this much?

Why am I still chained to memories she’s already let go of?
Why can’t I move on like she did?

I don’t want to keep suffering.
I don’t want to keep struggling every night to erase a name
that’s carved so deeply into my soul.
All I ask, God…
Is to set me free.

Free from her love.
Free from her magic.
Free from the spell she left in my heart.

I’m tired of loving someone
who stopped loving me long ago.

Just let me go.
Please.

I told him I’d focus on my needs and my feelings to heal and I realized part of that has been our problem, every time I argued with him it was because I didn’t feel loved by him the way I’d like but I was always the one to apologize for it after.
Yesterday I was getting out of work I was just tired and needed a nap and all but I was sad because I just missed him, I still miss doing stuff with him and I remember a few days ago before that I was bringing up stuff we can don(were LDR rn) and I wanted to watch shows with him whenever we could and he said sure, I’d keep reminding him and hed keep saying “yeah in a minute I’ll lyk” it’s not that he’s ignoring me ofc he just wasnt thinking about it so I was upset and brought it up basically saying he doesn’t make me feel loved anymore and that my love language was like , time, affirmation, whatever whatever and he was like “well I’m low maintenance , I don’t need a lot so I don’t expect to need to do a lot either, you like doing things but I like relaxing and it feels like I always have to prove things to you”
I’m probably explaining this so bad because I’m just so upset, and I was like well don’t you ever feel like you want things with me too or you think about me lkke I do for you and hes like “yeah but.. to a point” and then I realized what it was 
Our problem is we love too differently, 
 that IVE been dismissing and invalidating my own feelings to feel and do lesss for him, I lvoe so deeply and I kept thinking my expectations were too high and that things should feel “relaxed” or “normal” but then that stuff hurts me

You shouldn’t have stopped"
no contact isn’t as easy as “just don’t do it.”,"i’ve seen so many posts and comments say stuff like “don’t reach out,” “it’s not worth it,” or “stay strong, no contact is the best option” and while i get where that advice is coming from and maybe deep down i even agree, it’s just not that simple when you’re the one actually going through it.

no one really tells you how to do it. how to sit with the urge to message them when your chest physically aches. how to stop replaying every memory and wondering if it could’ve gone different. how to deal with nights that feel endless, when you’re alone with no one to talk to and they were once the person who made you feel safe.

people don’t always realize how isolating it can be. not everyone has a solid group of friends or a supportive family. some of us truly feel like we’ve lost the one person we could be vulnerable with, even if the relationship wasn’t good for us. and sometimes, just knowing it wasn’t good doesn’t make the feelings go away. if anything, it makes them more confusing.

every situation’s different. every heart heals at its own pace. so while “no contact” might be the right path, it doesn’t feel empowering at first, it feels like grief. it feels like silence screaming back at you. and in those moments, we don’t need just commands like “don’t do it.” we need understanding and compassion. a safe space to be real about how hard it actually is.

so if you’re struggling with no contact right now, i see you. i feel you. you’re not weak. you’re not doing it wrong. you’re just human, and healing something that meant a lot to you.

There's still so much love, and I feel so lost in a world without him. ||| Lemme tell you about my experience  I don’t have much friends, and I live in a different country than my family So when my ex (she was everything I had in life) and I broke up, I had to go no contact for my own sanity and mentality. I struggled in the beginning but here is what I did to help: 1. Wake up early and never take a nap afternoon or during the day. After couple days, you will start sleeping early from exhaustion, avoiding all those late night overthinking and replaying every memory you had with them 2. Have a busy schedule, I don’t care what you in life, just have a routine. If you have a job, maybe just take some overtime. Read books. Watch movies. Go for a walk listening to your favorite songs or podcasts.  3. Go to the gym, improve your physique, it makes you feel better about yourself. Get a haircut. Do everything to feel like a new person.  4. Learn new stuff, youtube and online websites are full of free stuff to learn from. Internet is a blessing those days.  5. Block her social media, delete the photos and conversations. Leave no trace of her in your life. Dont hope she will come back. She left for a reason.  6. If you did all the above points, you wont have time to check her social media, or think about texting her. When time passes you will move on.   When to know you moved on? When you stop caring, you wont get upset when a memory comes to your mind, you will be able to talk about her as something in the past without feeling sad or nostalgic.   Good luck my friend, and keep in mind Im here for you whenever you need someone to talk to. ||| For me going NO CONTACT is the most painful thing knowing that I can no longer speak to him I'm absolutely gutted they say it gets easier with time I don't think that is true ||| I'm dealing with this now. I'm sorry you're struggling also. My distractions aren't distracting me. The silence screams from no calls or texts at me. I feel like half of me is missing. And my future I had been planning for is erased. ||| No contact is hard. Sometimes, really hard. I got broken up with five months ago and haven’t reached out once. Here’s what I have to say about it.   It takes discipline and emotional maturity. Understand the hard truth, that they took a good look at you and decided that their future would be better without you in it. Hurts, right? I know all too well. But the pain isn’t permanent. Let it fuel you to learn, grow, and work hard at yourself to become a better person for you, not for your ex. Knowing that your ex is making an active decision to keep away from you every day, the most mature thing to do is let them have that distance. If you loved them and respected them, respect their decision and stay away.   Understand that contacting them holds the very real possibility of opening a very ugly can of worms. No looking at their online profiles, no asking mutual friends about them, no messaging or calling. They were an important part of your past, but keeping them tied to your present is not doing you any favors when trying to move on. Let them stay in the past. You can appreciate what you had without clinging to it, but that appreciation often comes later. Focus on getting through day-by-day without them participating in your daily life, and you’ll see that you can do it. It gets easier with practice.   Lean on friends and family during hard times if you’ve got them. Find support in anonymous groups like these. Message me personally if you need someone to talk to, and I’d be happy to provide comfort, reassurance, and support. I know it feels like your world is falling apart… my ex broke me, but I took the time to build myself back up, stronger and more successful than ever, without her by my side. YOU WILL GET THERE, let your faith in yourself carry you towards the other side. ||| i hear you, ive been going through the same and idk how to deal with it. ig life just goes on but here's what's been helping me \~   I was in a relationship where the guy put a lot of restrictions on me so I started doing the things I couldn't do when I was with him (hitting the gym,hiking,solo dates,)   when I want someone to talk to I just talk to chatgpt XD, cant replace him but yes, at least you'll have someone who'll listen to you?    i miss him a lot too, I get those urges to text him and let him know that I again bumped my head into the wall or that I met another cute puppy today or that I want to go to a new cafe with him that just opened but I cant do that and I think thats good for both of us ||| you have described everything perfectly.   i miss him so much. i would do anything just to see him. i know we wasn’t the best, but he was the only person i was vulnerable with (i don’t tell anyone how i feel, not really a soft person but with him i was, he always made me feel better), he was the only person i was happy with, i was sad with, i ranted too. he was my person. and i know there was moments that it wasn’t good. but he was also so gentle with me so kind and caring. then i remember everything he did and i hate him. but i don’t i love him. my heart feels heavy, like someone is sat on me, i feel like screaming. whenever I finally open up to my friends it always no he was no good, no do better, no you don’t need him in your life. when really i do. he the only person i need. they heard me rant about situations where i was angry bit they didn’t see how deeply in love we were when together.  so OP if you are feeling similar, same. so if you ever need someone to talk to you can always message me! hope your okay x ||| It’s painful either way, for me personally.

Don’t put yourself in the position to text her mom or sister because she will say something and they will defend her not you.

On the thread of getting back with exes..,"There are SO MANY people out there, especially living in a city or moving around like I have. I connect with people really well, it’s one of my strengths. I have been in love with two of my exes, but it just hasn’t been quite right because each of us have needed to grow so much to make the relationship work. 

I am not opposed to meeting new people, but I am just so rarely sincerely attracted to new potential partners that these former partners can seem like the best options, if only the timing was right and the correct work was done. 

Anyways, I keep thinking that I need to move on because obviously I’ve found more than one person to fall for so there must be more, but it’s interesting to me that so many people share this feeling of wanting to make it work with an ex. 

So I am curious about personal feedback on this front?",7,8,2025-06-29 07:38:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln8xwl/on_the_thread_of_getting_back_with_exes/,,,"Every connection is unique.

I think I only want to go back because love is a chemical reaction. I crave the safety and familiarity he gave. But at the same time, I thought about breaking up with him for several months. And all my thoughts led back to a breakup being the right decision. But now that I’m no longer as rational as before, I find it difficult to hold on to the thoughts that I had before.

Gross but funny thing I’ve been thinking about,"I was broken up with almost two months ago, after trying again with the same girl after we broke up in January. Recently, it has been discovered that my ex has been in a relationship with my friend for a month, that started two weeks after the breakup. 

Said friend has been around my ex’s house, slept with them, been going out with them, the lot. Whilst hiding it from me, our other friends and my friend’s long distance girlfriend. 

When I heard that this friend had stayed over at their house, I realised something really grim. Basically, my ex is one of the messiest people I’ve ever met, this includes not changing their bedsheets on a regular basis. 

One time when I stayed around their house, I accidentally bleed on their bedsheets and it went through to the mattress. Still, the sheets were not changed until a while later and they have no idea how to clean blood out of a mattress despite growing up around other women.  

So what I thought of was, my blood is still on that mattress, and those sheets, because yes, whilst they were washed at the beginning of March, the  blood didn’t come out. My ex is stuck with a forever bloodied mattress and my friend has slept in my period blood, as has anyone else that they have had sleeping in that bed.

How to go about getting one's stuff back,"Sorry, this is my second post about the same breakup but different topic (hope this is allowed).

My partner lives in another country and I lived there for a while before we went long distance.
He left 2 days ago and said he'd send what I left at his parents' house back via post.
At the time, out of sadness I said I'd rather he sold it, donated it or threw it out.

Now I kind of want to get some of it back.
I have been doing no contact (even if I'd like to check on him) as I know that is what he would prefer. And I don't want to look pathetic and make him feel valid in his decision to leave further.

How do I go about contacting him? A simple 'Hi, I have changed my mind about getting my stuff back. Can you send me a list to go through?' ?
Is it OK to ask how he is doing or should I wait and see if he asks me?

Any help appreciated in those dark and uncertain times ",1,3,2025-06-29 18:01:20,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnl55m/how_to_go_about_getting_ones_stuff_back/,,,"Forget about your stuff. You can replace those items. You’re just concealing your intention of getting in contact with him. Move on from him and move on from what you’ve left with him.  If you try to contact him for your stuff, he’ll see through it. He knows, you’re just using your stuff to make contact. Don’t. Specially if he left you and didn’t show any effort of taking you back.  Take pride my friend.."
This is the closure i needed. Everything makes sense now haha,"So my friend sent me my ex's bio which said 
""wore a borrowed skin for a love not my own. now unmasking to bloom where i am truly known.""

 Which means, 

The phrase ""wore a borrowed skin for a love not my own"" is a metaphorical expression. It suggests a feeling of being inauthentic or pretending to be someone else in order to pursue a relationship or affection that was not genuinely meant for them. The ""borrowed skin"" represents a false persona or a way of acting that is not true to oneself, while the ""love not my own"" highlights the unrequited or ultimately unattainable nature of the affection being sought.

 I knew everything was fake, after he brokeup with me over that he lost feelings and I was treating him shit. And i never got to know anything beyond that. That fucking victim mindset of his. Now he's putting bio and username like it's ok to be forgotten? Who forgot you man, your ex lmao 
I hope this man never finds you. Everything was fake. All he did was pretend to come into a relationship and when he realised I'm not what he thought or wanted or I'm just not his ex, he just left me after disrespecting me and sl&t shaming me. I hope he rots in h3ll.

"Left holding everything - partner leaving, possibly cheating, emotionally cold, and I’m exhausted","I’m 31 and live in the UK. My husband (34) and I have been together for 8.5 years, married for 3.5. Last month, after a mental health breakdown due to years of burnout, grief, and emotional exhaustion, he told me he wasn’t happy and didn’t want to be in the relationship anymore.

We share two children - twin boys (13) from his previous relationship, whose mum died in 2020. I adopted them. One of them has additional needs, which brings its own challenges, but I love them with all my heart. Seeing them heartbroken is devastating.

He originally said he wanted to work on things, came back home, and then just… didn’t try. No affection. I had to ask for hugs. He finally admitted he didn’t want to kiss me anymore, and then ended it completely.

Now he’s still living in our home while “sorting himself out” - using the living room as a bedroom, making no effort to keep it tidy, leaving me feeling completely stuck in limbo.

There’s also another woman. I found 19 calls to her in the 4 days before we split. At the beginning of this week he disappeared for the evening and then told me he went to her house to “eat dinner and watch love island”. A few days later, he finished work at midday (normally works til 5/6) had a shower and doused himself in aftershave then left to “give her a lift” to the garage. He was gone for 5 hours. This weekend, while supposedly housesitting for his mum (which he’s never done before), he said he was going to be out from early morning til late at night (yesterday/saturday) but refused to tell me where he’d be — then was seen by my sister going to the same woman’s home again after denying that he was spending the day with her.

He still denies it and calls her “just a friend.”

He says one of the reasons our relationship broke down is because my grief made us drift apart - that losing my dad and grandad (both of whom I cared for through cancer, until their deaths last year) made it hard for us to be a couple. Said it was inconvenient for him. He even says the fact I was raped and tortured before we got together “bothers” him, because it makes him uncomfortable not knowing who the attacker is so he can’t relax when he goes out with friends.

I’ve also supported him financially for years. Before Christmas, he decided he “didn’t want to work anymore” and I covered everything. Right now, he owes me £17,000 and hasn’t acknowledged it. Once he moves out, I’ll need to find an extra £1,500/month just to keep up with bills and rent.

I feel rage. I feel grief. I feel betrayed. I’ve kept our family, our finances, and our home going while he’s planned an escape - and now I’m the one rebuilding from scratch.

I don’t want sympathy. I want to know:
How do I get through this part?
The anger, the exhaustion, the heartbreak, the sheer unfairness of it?

Sometimes someone is just not the best person for us. The best way is to try to be forgiving to those who have hurt us. As hard as that may be. We never truly know the battles the ones we love are facing. The best revenge is to be happy. Know you are strong and you will figure it out. You have to have faith in yourself. And know you are worth it. You have to remind yourself you are worthy of a good life. And to be happy is a choice. We cannot plan for the future when living in the past. Keep moving forward and concentrate on your children and yourself. Enjoy your newfound freedom and try to live each day to the fullest. Life is short. We don’t move on because we want to. But because we have to. You can’t enjoy the highs without experiencing the lows. Life has endless possibilities. Sometimes things are blessings in disguise. As long as you have faith in yourself and live life with purpose you will be fine. All is healed with time.

Avoidant discard: Is there a chance he will reach out? despite long distance and problems we had,"Short version:

He avoidant discarded me and I want him to reach out again after few months, because I have heard it is possible. I truly loved him and if I knew he was avoidant earlier I could do so much stuff differently.


I am not contacting him on purpose, because now he is like a brick wall.


There was a lot of issues in our relationship, like intimacy issues, my mental health issues and he had no money, no support and I was helping him so maybe it hindered his confidence around me. I am also very vocal person and I like to sort issues with talking, which he always tried to run away from.


Due to circumstances we had to go temporarily long distance and he was meant to find flat for us, he never did so I accepted it and was willing to wait until he is ready.


Now he is on his feet he discarded me, said he lost feelings 4 weeks ago, I feel used and lied to. His promises ruined my life and left me with no money. So I know he feels guilty, but he also has reasons to twist me in his brain into some disgusting codependent person.


Is there a chance he will reach out after months or a chance he will miss me and remember me, despite the baggage and long distance?


Long story for people who want more context:

The story of our relationship is filled with turmoil from external stuff like jobs and student poverty, it lasted over 3 years. He was struggling a lot, I mean like A LOT. Due to his issues I supported him to the best of my ability and I sacrificed for him, over span of 2 years I gave this man over 5000 £.


At some point in the relationship we had intimacy issue around sex, he was ill and not in the mood, but I found out he was watching a lot of porn on the side. I accepted it initially, but as time went on and his illness was becoming manageable nothing changed from his perspective, which to me looked like he does not enjoy looking at my body and he does not care to help our issue. He reassured me, made promises to cut down on porn, but he lied, every time I asked him why he does it so much he would say that he does not know. So I was confused, but left it alone after a year of struggle, but we did not have sex for a very long time. He probably feels guilty for hurting me so badly, cos it put me in a really rough shape. If I knew he was avoidant I would handle all of it differently. Our relationship was still strong, we were each others best friends and we were still really loving.


I built my life around him (clearly out of my own stupidity), I refused job opportunities, didnt make independent plans, worked on my insecurities, lost pre settled status in the UK, I had to leave UK to wait for him - those decisions were all fuelled by how loved he made me feel and his promises.


Then there came time when he was put back on his tracks, he finally gained independence from his parents and got a job he wanted. I supported him and was so happy for him.


Now I was the one needing his help, I was traumatised by job experiences and had anger issues (never lashed out on him, but I know it bothered him). I got diagnosed with ADHD, autism, anxiety, depression, OCD and CPTSD. I worked on myself and saw the results, he was meant to find a flat for us so I can come join him in England (life forced us to be temporary long distance). He said he is happy to provide for me and that he just wants me to be happy. He said he wanted to repay me for stuff I did for him in his darkest time.


I always mistook his calm and stoic attitude for sign of emotional maturity. If I knew he was that level of dismissive avoidant back then I could easily identify the signs and I would know that this level of responsibility and his fear of losing independence would cause him to crumble and I will become danger and liability to preserving his routine. He never said he needed me to be certain way, he never voiced any issues or concerns.


And then poof, one night before he was meant to come visit me he texted me he that he is not coming because he does not want to. I called him, I was furious, I was pleading with him to come just to see if he is right about his feelings, I asked why and got meet with vagueness. He said that four weeks ago he decided that he does not love me anymore because he stopped missing me. When I asked him why he stopped living me he said he does not know, that it is the distance (that he was meant to solve by finding flat for us), that he has good routine he does not want to get rid off. I said that it is impossible, people dont just lose feelings for no reason and that he knows me being away is temporary due to my financial issues. I said that I helped him through his, so why when it is his turn he just suddenly does not love me. I said that he never communicated any concerns and said anything. His responses were silence or repeating the same vague stuff, he also said that he experiences a lot of anxiety and has to constantly be at his stressful job to numb himself. He says he feels sorry and he knows it is his fault I am in this position because of his promises. He also cried when I broke down to him about the fact that I lost everything because of my mental illness and people pleasing.


In the morning when I was reading I realised that he was always DA and I was just uneducated enough to see the signs. So I messaged him knowing he wont respond, but I had to because I care about him. I said he should consider wether he is a dismissive avoidant and adress his job anxiety (he is new prison guard), because it might get worse for him. I apologised for being angry and I said that I know I am not getting him back.


I realised that I am FA because of that and I still want him back, but I will not say that to him. I feel that if I knew our attachment styles there is no much stuff that I would fix, so much things I would do differently.


I have heard they do reach out after few months, but when I look at the way I mistreated him because of my lack of understanding and he could never say it to me because of his avoidance, and when I look at the fact it is long distance and I can not come back to England because I am financially compromised, I doubt he will ever reach out, but I want it so badly.


Can you give me your thoughts on whether there is a chance or not?",2,5,2025-06-29 13:51:04,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnf6c6/avoidant_discard_is_there_a_chance_he_will_reach/,,,"Gosh, did we date the same person?

It’s been 2 months for me now and I don’t know if I ever hear from him again ||| These people are all the same. My ex never told me she had a single issue with me or our relationship, I’d always ask if she was ok or if there was anything I could do to accommodate her better. I offered her space, she said nothing. I offered to talk to her, she said nothing. I had a sudden fear she was going to end things so I voiced this to her and she told me she was just burnt out and told me she loved me - 2 days later boom I’m dumped over text with stupid excuses that make no sense whatsoever and when I ask to talk to her to see if things can be resolved she simply told me ‘she can’t do that’ - she showed zero empathy or care about me and couldn’t seem to understand why I reacted with such shock to how she handled things and instead held it against me.   I told my ex I thought she was avoidant and she ghosted me after that, her friend reached out and told me I was immature and that I ‘wasn’t owed a perfect break up’ when I’d been lied to and ditched over text with no empathy after treating her with nothing but love and respect - we hadn’t even had a fight. It’s a truly baffling experience some people can’t grasp. You’ve gotta question though I think why would you want that person back if they’d rather drop you and run than try to resolve any issues? I say this as if I don’t still hold out hope of hearing from mine but I don’t think I ever will based off how she dropped me."
Day 7 of my breakup,"Last Sunday my boyfriend of 2.5 years broke it off with me, saying that we’re fine as friends and we’re just too different romantically. He’s fine with distance and I’m a bit clingy (with the right people), he refused to tell me things that were bothering him for 4 months before he had to break it off. He recognized he was hurting me (yeah fucking finally) after refusing to share his feelings with me all this time. Even if it was little things that bothered him he would never tell me, I constantly told him that I was okay if he needed something from me or I was doing something to upset him to just come talk to me. He was always there to absorb my issues and there were only a handful of times where it felt better. We talked about the future and eventually moving in and all that and I’m just so broken right now. It’s gotten harder each day I wake up, fighting the fact I’m struggling with my self worth after this. He tore the everliving shit out of my heart, but I still love him. He said a part of him would always love me too. I think he just liked the idea of a girlfriend and there’s times where I wish I never had gotten that vulnerable that fast. I thought I found my soulmate. I really did. He really made me think that and it killed me when he made it easy for himself and quit.

I was always so understanding of his issues and inner turmoil and his past he would breadcrumb to me. The consistent effort was never there. It came and went. He wants to have fun, I don’t think he was ever ready for a relationship, but we both just got excited.

It’s killing me more everyday bc I gave so much of myself to him.
It’s dumb bc he still has his pfp’s of himself up next to a compliment I wrote in his mirror. It infuriates me to my core that he still has little things up to the public like that. Knowing how he felt now for the past four months. I should’ve known I should’ve pressed my brain is full of I should’ve I would’ve I could’ve. And it’s not fair bc I’m not the one who ripped someone’s fucking heart out.
He made it easy by leaving. There were so many chances to talk things out and he didn’t take a single one. 
He never really loved me and he lied to me basically this whole relationship by not being honest about the small things. And I can’t ever forgive him for that. Crazy thing is he said he “doesn’t want to cut me out of his life yet” and still wants to be friends.

Yaps,"Hey,so me and my ex broke up a year ago, September 12 due to religions n it wont work out n stuff. After the broke up we were closer, doing more stuff like hanging out more,sleeping on calls and etc. it felt hella nice but also not at the same time. By the end of the year, we had a party for year end at school. After i ate, i decided to go to my class to just chill alone yk. She called me asking where i was saying she missed me and wanna hangout. So we did at class. Cuddling and sleeping together. When school yeae starts again we were still close calling and walking together. Its js after the holiday. she called me at night like normal. I asked her the question.What Are We. She was half awake which means she’s more honest but wont remember so she anwsered. Im not sure. Ask her if we were js no label. She sakd to me “i think we should stop whatever we’re doing *my name* its bad for both of us. There was  a akward silence for a bit. I called her name and she  was asleep. The following week she js stop talking to me. Other then our streaks on tiktok she doesnt talk to me. I was like ok maybe its time she’s moving on. She also started hanging out w my close friend who is a person im worried for relationship. They started walking together after school and walk together when she is doing her probationary duty. I was getting quite jealous,angry or mad. Im not sure which. A mix of them ig. My school does theater. I was in it with said friend. We had a thing called PA weekend which is js for fun get to know each other n do activities. One of the activities included perfoming a song. My friend and ex was in the same team. In the performance they did it started as a skit and it involved w them hugging. It was very uncomfortable for me afterwards that even my friend was asking me if i was ok. I tolled them i was ok. A month passed, and we started doing practices for the show. I was always focused on my work and always getting compliments from the teachers. But guess what? They were hanging out most of the time. Lunch time they would go walk to a 7/11 to eat together. Sit together at the sofa prop for the show and more. It was super irritating for me and made me more distracted.they were super touchy too. Now we’re back in school and they’re still hanging out together when they want to. At first i was like “ok think first maybe he just didnt know ” even tho he had tease me about her.Then recently my friends had a question do people in a relationship still watch adult content. He looked at me and ask “since u got a gf, do u still watch?” I was genuinely gonna throw a punch but i remembered he was my friend so i didnt and pretended i didnt hear. I was like ok if u think im still dating w her. Why the hell are u so close w her even if i was “dating” her. Or if u know im not dating w her anymore why are u still so close w her. 

Im sorry if its weirdly structured i js needed to vent about this cause in worried for her cause his not really a green flag and has lost his virginity at 14-15.

I found 8-9 months ago, now we're graduating and i need a helpful fresh perspective before i confront them and finally sever all ties. I have noone to talk to about this. I am so torn. 

So my (22F) university friends who were literally like my family had been talking so much shit about me, some of which was true and some absolutely wasn't. And some of it was so petty, you wouldn't even consider it as something to ""discuss"". [If someone wants clarity, i'll give some more examples in the comments.]

But i found out as i was sending some pictures from my friend's whatsapp to my number , with her consent. I didn't know how she had saved my contact so i just searched my name in the chatbox and voila, before my chat, other chats appeared with my name in them. All of them negative. It crushed me and broke my heart like never ever. I had been through the most terrible times in that year (majority of my friends never left a text to even check up on me even though they knew what was happening) Still  the only safety i had felt during those times was with those friends until i found out that they had been trashing me on the smallest of things, constantly speculating about my life and relationships etc. 

I have always celebrated my birthday on my own and arranged it for myself on my own. That year, i just needed a little love and consideration so i casually told them what i wanted for my birthday (which was just flowers, rings and homemade cupcakes- nothing else) but then i found out none of them wanted to do anything for me. More than that, they were discussing it how they're not interested and how i'm being so shameless and low asking for these things. Tons of other things.

One of them (Lets call her A) had a reason that she felt like she couldn't come talk to me when she was falling apart with another mutual friend group. From my perspective, i listened to her and validated her BUT i offered her a perspectibe of the other side (which she saw as me defending them while invalidating her and she said you're more their friend than mine) and hence she drifted away. But would that justify trashing me so much to my friends?  There are tons of comments and their backstories too. 

Another friend (say: B) talked about me not only to my friend but also to her friends who didn't know me and there was so much shit that my mind was blown. I had never meant any of that to come off as that deep or disgusting as she made it out to be.

Friend C is a very impressionable person. She's the sweetest and kindest human ever but if she respects someone, her opinions will become what that respectable person says. In this case, friend B is a goddess in her eyes so it already made sense for her to be so conceited towards me.

Some of the things were right, that i come off as prickly sometimes (it's never intentional. Its just straightforward statement with no smile but even my sister said you sometimes seem rude. And i am working on that). Some were downright wrong

I don't understand why these girls assumed so much malice on my part. They have only been talking to one another, hopefully not outside of my circle. I also never assumed anyone of them to be insecure or jealous of me. I have always been seen as a very attractive woman and have always had loads of male attention, even to an uncomfortable extent. I belong to an affluent and influential background but so does Friend B. And friend A is so so gorgeous and confident and a social butterfly, literally rules our whole class and department so why would she have a reason to be jealous. [ even though last year my sister met them and she said she picked some negative vibes from her. She also made several comments about my skin, and how my body is sexy and that's what men find attractive even if a woman doesn't have a pretty face. I never thought anything about those comments cuz i am very secure in my looks] 

Moving on, Friend B is also pretty, rich, privileged and really classy (also the most respected person in our group) so i have no idea what went down. I feel like such a problem. Now we're graduating and i'll finally confront them and leave the group (had my reasons for not leaving it 8 months back when i found out that i'll tell if someone wants to know) 

But what do i do? Has anyone been through a similar situation? I am breaking up with them this week (and i'll have to see them again next month still during our defense and final clearances etc) I am kinda confused and satisfied but really satisfied.

please tell me it gets better,"me and my boyfriend of 5 years broke up around february but were seeing eachother up untill around a month ago. i still love him with my whole heart and want to be with him and i thought he felt the same way. 
we spent the night together last week and i really felt so happy and hopeful that this was the step to us properly getting back together,
at a moment of weakness yesterday i was messaging him how much i love him care for him and want nothing more than to make us work. he said he wanted me to hate him- then said he’s seeing someone else and he’s sorry.
i havnt slept for 40 hours. i cannot eat. my chest is tight and i need to have someone around me at all times. i feel like my life is over. i thought he still loved me. i’m going to the doctors tomorrow to see if i can get some medication because i’m suffering so badly. this feels like the end of my life. and i wish it was so i wouldn’t have to feel this pain.

You need to feel all the pain and take lots and lots of realization to convince yourself that it is all over. The best is that you discover a new chapter of yourself. I just do not know how long. As healing is not linear. Take time and be kind to yourself. Even if it is slow, you are still healing. You just don't feel it now. Healing is like snowball. It starts small and it gets bigger and bigger over time. Until you see that both of you are not really meant to be. Take it slow. This is life. Cheers to your freedom! Cry if you must. It is okay to be not okay. :)"
Confused,"I’m so confused.

I’ve spent so much time trying to decode his words, his bio, his silence. But at this point, I’m done interpreting. Even though I know, deep down, he probably still loves me, but he chose not to reach out. 

I sent him an email once. Honest, direct, and carry emotional weight. I poured everything out. And now, he’s changed his bio to something that paints me as the one who keeps hurting him. It’s like I’m being made into the villain when all I did was love him and keep showing up, even when he went silent for 2 months straight.

I was the one reaching out with kindness, with patience. The last thing he told me was that he was depressed and that it was all about him, not me. 

Now I’m back to interpreting everything again. It’s so draining.",3,2,2025-06-29 11:23:05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnccfq/confused/,,2 month(s),"Girl..

Need help,"Me and my ex gf got broke up on Wednesday. She tried to call me multiple time to fix things. But I was to hurted by her action that I didn't want to talk with her. She stopped calling me. 

20 min ago I texted her to call me at 12o'clock. She insulted me. 

What should be my next move? Looks like she forgot that she was the problem, lmao",1,2,2025-06-29 17:18:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnk3bm/need_help/,,,"Your next move is simple. Walk away and stay gone.  You had your chance to talk it out. You passed. That was your right. But now that the hurt settled in and you're ready, she’s not. That’s her right too.  She lashed out? Sure. Probably felt rejected, angry, maybe even embarrassed. Doesn’t make it okay, but it explains it.  But don’t sit there acting like she “forgot” she was the problem. If it was that clear-cut, she’d still be chasing. She stopped for a reason. And now you’re chasing her.  So here’s the truth: if you wanted to fix it, you should’ve talked when she reached out. You didn’t. Now it’s over. Take the hit, learn the lesson, move on like a man.  No more texts. No more calls. No more ego games. Just forward."
Regret or Confusion,"I feel that I fucked up hard.
I hope my story isn't too long, but I'm curious what do you think.

We had been building our life quite quickly, because for a long time (8 months), we had never thought about leaving each other. She moved to me pretty fast (~3 weeks), and after around 8 months we moved to a bigger flat. The reason being to make space for her clothing, and stuff, but I had became extremely exhausted and thought I can't bear it anymore how it felt living together. We went to therapy (even though I initiated discussions about our problems) but communication hardly worked. Later I also realised some narcissistic behaviour (e.g. gaslighting, guilt-tripping and shifting). After Valentianes, I just snapped and felt, that's enough, and dumped her. (Afterwards I apologised and tried to start again, but she had gradually lost feelings.)

Since then, I've been suffering  a lot, but I started letting go since a while.

The point is that I really think she was special, we made so many happy memories. It was so great to travel with her anywhere, we had the same interests, a bit childish behaviour, cuteness. Love for animals, gaming. I liked how she squirted and moaned, and her bright blue eyes. It really felt like a unique bond. And I know it was partly trauma-bond and partly something that was made by our deviant personality.

But we had a lot of arguments, and for some reason they became worse and worse until we drove each other insane to the point I despised and sometimes even hated her.

We were trying to fix us, but we couldn't. And I regret this. That I couldn't see the good in her, and there is no turning back now. As writing this I just got confused. I actually don't regret it, rather proud of that when the last moment when we discussed what to do she said ""We can fix this with 1 year therapy"" I replied: ""And we ruin each other until then?"". Fuck, I'm not sure, but maybe at that moment I felt the pain more. She wanted to marry me, but I knew there is a long way ahead.

Somehow, separation was inevitable, but I realised many of my mistakes and I could accept her as she is, but she moved on. I'm just another villain in her story now. I miss her so much, her personality, her thighs.",1,2,2025-06-29 17:17:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnk2b3/regret_or_confusion/,,,"Alright. You didn’t fuck up. You woke up.  You didn’t leave a perfect woman. You left a messy, complicated, sometimes beautiful, sometimes toxic relationship that was draining the life out of you. That’s not failure. That’s self-preservation.  You miss her? Of course you do. You built a life together. Shared laughter, sex, dreams, inside jokes. But missing someone doesn’t mean you’re meant to be with them. It just means you're human.  And let’s not sugarcoat the other part. You didn’t just ""have arguments."" You said you despised her. Hated her at times. That’s not love. That’s a war zone. You were both bleeding and calling it passion.  The fact that she wanted to “fix it in a year of therapy” doesn’t mean you owed it to her. You saw where it was headed and made the hard call. That’s not weakness. That’s guts.  Now you’re sitting in the quiet, missing the good parts, sexual and emotional, and wondering if it was a mistake. It wasn’t. It just hurts. That’s the tax you pay for loving someone who wasn’t good for you long-term.  You’re not a villain. You’re not a hero either. You’re just a man who chose not to burn with someone who felt like home and hell at the same time.  Let her go. Keep the lessons. Grieve what was good. And don’t lose yourself chasing something you already outgrew."
Anyone ever felt like they could never find someone like their Ex?,"Long story short we dated for 9 months, but then when she told her family about me they didn't like me. I am Filipino Canadian and she is of Desi Indian so only same caste and arrange is what they prefer.

We were so good we both worked in the same hospital at Nurses. We both had many differences but we enjoyed each others company, she never ate meat and I did etc.. I am Catholic she is Hindu..

Its been like a week and it has ended cause she said she did not want to fight with her family as she is tired and is just waiting for them to arrange her. My 2 sisters told me to stop beating myself up, and that I should find someone that will care for me.

Like she was great, she cared a lot, always made sure I was okay, I guess its because she was my first GF? We are both 27. Like any man would love to be with her. She was that good. Its just the family thing, but I feel bad because I don't think I will find someone like her ever again.",1,3,2025-06-29 17:08:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnjv12/anyone_ever_felt_like_they_could_never_find/,,9 month(s),"Of course you feel that way. You gave your heart to someone who felt like home, and she left not because you failed, but because her family pulled the strings tighter than her love could hold. That kind of ending cuts deep because it wasn’t really your choice.  But listen close. This isn’t about whether she was “that good” or not. It’s about what she chose. She chose peace with her family over a fight for you. That’s not a character flaw, but it’s damn sure clarity. You were willing to face the world with her. She wasn’t willing to face her living room.  You’re not broken. You’re grieving the idea of what could’ve been. But don’t romanticize it into something perfect. You were unequally matched where it mattered most — commitment in the face of pressure.  You will find someone again. Maybe not like her. Maybe better. Different. And this time, she’ll be someone who chooses you without hesitation, even if it rattles her world. That’s what you wait for. Not someone who’s just “great.” Someone who’s great for you."

Categorically the worst breakups,"The ones where you both still want and love each other. Where the only thing holding back trying again, is fear of the past repeating and things not working. 

Where you know exactly where you went wrong and how you could have done things differently to not even be in this position in the first place. 

Where you don’t want anyone else, but the chance to have the person you want back may never come, because the fear might overshadow the love.

I would rather try again and again, learn, experiment, adjust and everything else with him than to “find someone better”.   He didn’t. He didn’t want to try anymore, and it breaks my heart every single day. ||| he broke up with me almost two months ago now. i knew then it was something we could work on but his fear overshadowed his love for me & us. i’ve done so much reflecting & i feel like i understand him better & what went wrong. we had an instant connection & i haven’t felt that way with anyone else. i’m a firm believer in “the grass is greener where you water it.” i want to tend to our garden, but he’s afraid to. it hurts but i can’t force him to work on something he doesn’t want to work on. ||| Mine ended like this and I reached out and he agreed to talk. Pray for me!!! ||| One I don’t hear talked about a lot is the kind of break-up I had. The relationship was amazing, real soulmate shit. But she discovered she was lesbian; she just thought that because we had a good relationship that it would work. But you can’t deny who you are. Those are the types of breakups where I think it’s the worst. No real reason for breaking up other than that one incompatibility, but also absolutely no hope of ever getting them back. So you’re left with so much love for a person with no real reason to not love them or no reason to find someone else.

Im already working on myself since day one. So far, day 67 after the breakup. I'm feeling a bit better. Psychologist and therapist DO help A LOT. So far, I have used 450 eur on them. The therapist is free from the state. And psychologist is 85 eur. I recommend it.   Plus, read books on self-improvement. And join groups for helping you overcome this time. And make new friends. ||| 👏👏👏👏the. absolute. worst.  i feel your pain op. hang in there.  try and try again as long as your heart is telling you to. you will 110% regret it way more if you don’t try. ||| in my case. My ex broke with me because I couldn't convince at home and I kept on stretching things, relationship didn't move anywhere for 3 years (my fault and immaturity) so she married common friend within our friend circle within 6 months of breakup. So I had to exit friend circle also..Imagine how worthless lonely and stupid I feel everyday ||| I’m going through this right now, too. It’s horrible and one of the hardest things I’ve ever experienced. It’s crazy to know that there’s someone out there hurting just as much as me but nothing either of us can do to fix it right now. It’s just focus on moving forward and if we reconnect in the future, great, but there’s no point in waiting. I hope you’re able to find some peace. ||| She broke trust too much and I had to end it, too many secrets, too many lies. She wrote a massive letter and I want reply everyday. But when someone keeps eroding trust on purpose thinking you’ll never leave, they can’t play victim when you finally walk away. Her admitting to everything and wanting to fix it instead of gaslighting like before hurt the most but I never replied. I miss her everyday but out of self respect I can’t put myself through all those games again. Plus finding out her and my best friend had history right before we dated and both never told me was humiliating. Time will heal but this one definitely hurts more than anyone before."
I stalked my ex's rebound and here's the truth,"A few weeks ago, I viewed his profile. Maybe I expected him to be ugly. Maybe I hoped he would be. But what if my hands were shaking the whole time?

What if she was looking for reasons to stop blaming herself? What if she wasn’t trying to hate me… just trying to understand why she wasn’t “enough” for me? We’ve all been that person, scrolling through someone else’s life, trying to make peace with our own.

This post isn’t about being “the better one.” It’s about realizing we’re all collateral in someone else’s inability to love properly. And how easy it is to turn our pain into comparison instead of compassion.

So if you’ve ever looked at their page and felt like it meant something about you - it doesn’t.

That scrolling, that stalking—it’s just us trying to make sense of the mess they left behind. It’s not about them being better or worse. It’s about us searching for closure in a place that’ll never give it.  Your pain isn’t a reflection of your worth. It’s a wound from someone else’s failure to love right. Comparing yourself to whoever they moved on to? It’s poison. It won’t heal you. It’ll just keep you stuck.  Remember this: You’re not defined by their choices or the people they choose after you.

Healing isn’t pretty it’s messy, painful, and slow. But I’ve started working on myself, piece by piece. I’m learning to choose peace over chaos, self-worth over waiting. ||| I'm sorry to hear that. I highly suggest journaling. It really helps me during my first breakup because I have no one to talk to. Besides journaling I also suggest being around with your family , greet them and say that you love them. If you keep thinking about her I also suggest an intense workout. It will disturb your mind about thinking about her. Socializing is good too. If you are a student I suggest getting along with your classmates. If you are a worker same thing but with your co worker. Nothing you can do? I suggest establishing small goals such as volunteering yourself with some work or anything that makes you busy. If you have anything that makes you remember her such as photos or gifts then I suggest taking them away. Being lonely is better than with someone who makes you lonely. Please enjoy and take your time. ||| I have a few friends that I trust but I haven’t reached out to them since the breakup. I don’t have the mental energy to do my daily tasks, let alone to talk to people. I don’t have things figured out yet. My ex was literally my everything and I loved him dearly despite the nasty end.

Keep going. ||| I completely get what you’re experiencing since me and my gf of 2.5 years separated and she asked for space to process things and no contact. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do so I absolutely don’t blame you for breaking no contact.   While my breakup is ongoing and still recent I have been trying to cope with a variety of activities such as going to the gym, calling my parents several times a day, taking several walks outside instead of pacing, and even seeking therapy to just vent to someone and have them provide insight. If you’re able to concentrate I found some interesting TV shows to binge just to take my mind off the no contact as well. ||| I fully understand what you’re going through as I’m going through something similar. My and my gf of 3 and a half years recently broke up. We used to fall asleep on call every night.  Let things process for you. I know it’s hard and it’s going to be a hard road ahead. Just remember that healing has its ups and downs. some days you won’t think about her and other days she’s all you think about. And that’s okay. Start journaling, it helps with giving your thoughts a place to go.  What matters is that you’re here. One day at a time. You got this! ||| Buy a motorbike and join a local motor club.

Kinda struggling and need a bit of support,"I broke up with him a few weeks ago. This was the second time we have broken up. I gave him a chance to prove what he said he would but it was even worse this time and I could no longer go on like that. 

He didn’t do anything that bad. It’s just that we weren’t compatible and he was not good for me. We dated for around 6 months, I actually knew straight from the beginning we shouldn’t be dating but I kept going there and giving him lots of chances after many little fuck ups he’s done. 

He also has addiction problems to drugs which was very difficult for me to deal with but he kept giving me promises and knew how to soothe me with words but his actions wouldn’t prove and I always felt anxious. 

The relationship was toxic for me and I was feeling fine straight after the breakup but now I’m struggling quite a bit and I don’t have good support from family or friends. So feeling a bit lonely in this. 

I know I’ve done the right thing but I’m just a bit confused on why I started to struggle with the breakup more now. Is it because it was toxic for me but still fun to date and now my brain is missing something? Even though we weren’t compatible, he still treated me well somewhat and spoiled me with gifts.

Long story short during one out of fights or disagreements he started talking to other women. I would ask what’s up are we working on things, trying what… he explains what sounds like animosity towards me for behaviors that were shown from me feeling unheard/unhappy. 

Once I seen the messages in his phone I said nothing I did not start an argument instead I went with the flow I also adopted a friend of my own. I felt like it’s not fair for him to be the only one talking to other people. Tit for tat has always been once of my toxic traits 

Taking accountability it wasn’t right I should have just left after the messages but I was so confused because he begged me not to leave & would treat me mean & would treat these other women like princesses blew my mind. I grew very insecure about it & would just ask for reassurance. I kept trying to bring it up he would turn it into me wanting to fight when I was just trying to talk it out. 

I never got it ..reassurance or a damn my bad & he didn’t want to end things so I continued what we were doing all while also “matching his energy” with another random dude, and an old friend (with benefits) for entertainment. 

He broke things off for good after he seen the messages in my phone I stopped talking to the one guy from hinge months ago lol & it was never going anywhere. Old friend he was aware of also not going anywhere he’s nice but has like 8 kids with 4 baby mothers no….again just matching energy & getting my mind off things. I’ve always been pretty up front & honest too. When he asked I told him every detail without shame & told him why I did it & apologized for not leaving. There was sexting involved no pictures that’s as far as I went. 

I guess I keep waiting for him to owe his shit too. My problem is he’s like you’re disgusting, I can’t believe you did this while I was trying to work it out with you… days past now he’s saying well I only talked to those other girls because you were verbally abusive (I was) my mouth can be insane but it is (mostly) reactive. I basically ate what he said, what I did & agreed to break up for good. 

Fast fwd one week later & I told him we need some boundaries but he will not leave me alone. He pops up unannounced. He has his work truck parked out front, he tried to kiss me & asked me was I coming back to his house with our kid for the weekend. I got pissed he’s fucking with me & it’s making me insane. I feel stuck. I need some co parenting tips, detachment tips maybe. I obviously still love him very much but now I feel played or like he’s trying to humble me or something ??? I need to figure out how to move on. Suggestions ? ",1,0,2025-06-29 16:44:21,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnj8td/he_broke_up_with_me_but_wont_leave_me_alone/,,,
Has your ex had a revelation about your relationship?,"Last month, my ex texted me saying that she went to therapy and reflected our relationship saying that I made her feel like shit for most of it and how I never cared about her and was only a convenience to her. She texted me this after I told her I accidentally knocke dher graduation stoles off of the place they were hanging on. And its like... I'm broken. I know I had flaws. I know there were times I messed up. But I truly did love her. I wanted to do my best her her, and for her to tell me it was all wrong... it hurts.

I'm still not over those texts. I feel like such a villain. The fact that I hurt someone I loved in ways I didn't know... its awful. I know I cared for her. I comforted her when something went wrong. I encouraged her to follow her dreams. I would cook for her while she slept. I cleaned our place when she was at work (although, that should be expected). When she had a problem time something I did, I took her feedback to heart and changed. She even said that I always try to make things better. I gave her gifts, listened, and loved her so much. And it just feels like all of it came crashing down.

Sure, maybe she's lying about going to therapy. Maybe she feels bad about ending things and wants to shift blame. Maybe its her way of keeping herself away from me. But I know what our relationship was like, and I loved her so damn much. I just want to talk to her again, to sort things out, but I know I'll never get that chance again. To clarify, we broke up cause she wanted to explore, since I was her first and only boyfriend at that point, and told me that this isn't just all there is.",1,0,2025-06-29 16:40:17,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnj577/has_your_ex_had_a_revelation_about_your/,,,

Laugh at me✌🏼,"in my case.

We love each other but broke up,"Me and my high school love for 2 years have been together and seen each other basically everyday. I'm 16 and she is older by 1.5 years. We went to the same class because i started going to school earlier than usual, so i never noticed age difference between us and classmates who are all older than me by the same margin. Before starting our relationship we knew that she would leave our home country to study in university in Australia with her Dad who migrated there. But we decided that we will do something about it and kind of forgot about it for 1 year. Around November we talked a lot about moving to Austria instead, and i admit it was a compromise for both of us, because i didn't want to rush it while im too young to be alone abroad. She liked the idea and i did too. Then in January her friend convinced her that she shouldn't follow my dream, which is true but then we completely stopped talking about future until end of April, when i initiated. We stopped again, and in the beginning of June i was hit with a heartbreak of my life, since she is my first ever girlfriend, my first kiss and everything else. I learned that it is unrealistic for us to do long distance because she will study there for 5 years and i will stay in home country for at least 4 because we can't afford to study there, and otherwise i wouldn't even write this post, and would fly with her. Right know it's been around 20 days since our talk and we decided to stop talking to each other 2 days ago, because we will hurt each other by falling in love even more on the next 6 months while she is still here. What should i do? I can't hope that she won't leave the country because of some family issue etc. Maybe we did everything right? Right know i definitely know that i would get easier through this time if i had someone i could relate to like i did with her. But im getting bored with my friends (maybe because of my loss and my emotional state) , so i can't get myself to spend time with them. I do a lot of stuff alone, i have many hobbies that i interchange during the day, but i still miss her being part of my day. I also think she is special and she thinks the same about me, because there aren't many good kind and attractive people all combined where i live. I don't want to say i just want another relationship to rebound and get over her, but i also need advice on how to manage by social life. My Uni starts in 2 months and im sure i'll try to make new friends there, since my school ones are leaving.

And then just not contact her at all until she does it (if ever) with clear intentions and an apology for leaving me. ||| Similar situation here (LDR + broken up with due to loss of feelings). All I can tell you is that you likely aren't going to get clarity from her.  Don't ""stay friends"". Not to be jaded, but she might still want the emotional support of a relationship (you still love her so she'd always be able to get it from you) without the responsibility that comes with that kind of attachment.   Stay or go, you won't be getting the clarity from them if they've denied it so many times. Cut contact for your own sake. Take as much time as you need to grieve. Pour that love into yourself, as painful and difficult as it may be. You'll be okay 🫂."
3 months later,"It’s been a little less than 3 months since my ex bf 31M broke up with me 31F after 13 years, and it still feels like day 1 for me. Meanwhile he met a new girl only 1 month after we broke up, and is already in a committed relationship with her. I know what everyone says, that this is most likely a “rebound” but I genuinely never thought he was the type of person who would do that, so it hurts a lot. We didn’t have a bad breakup, he just lost feelings because of his mental illness and his ptsd from being a police officer. 

It sucks because just 3 weeks ago he was telling me that he misses me, looks at old pictures of us all the time, and that he wishes he communicated with me more when he wasn’t feeling good about things as maybe it would have saved the relationship. How does someone go from saying all that to then being in love and involved with someone new? It is absolutely heartbreaking. It is already so difficult to try to grieve and move on from a breakup you did not want.. but then to see them move on like you meant nothing? Wild.  

Now he is obviously acting cold with me, as he has replaced me with a new person so I am of no use for him anymore. The only thing that is somewhat keeping my mind at ease is that I know she is a rebound and he is trying to fill a void (he told me) but that doesn’t mean it won’t work out between them. His mom has also reached out to me and said that she has no idea who her son is anymore, and that he has changed into a completely different person who she doesn’t recognize (he also pushed her away because of his mental illness) which I know is common.

I know it's hard after so many shared years   It's a bleeding wound you have there, and it's time for you to heal it vy yourself with self-love. You were alright, it's not your fault and you deserve to be happy. But for now, all that energy you give for him?

I Think We Moved Too Fast and I Ruined Everything,"I want to preface this with I don’t think this really counts as a break up even though it feels like one. We met a few days ago but it hurts like one. We met off of a subreddit (I’m 25 and she’s 20) and we just hit it off right away. We would text throughout the day, talk all night and we just really knew what we wanted. At least that’s what I thought, I wrote her a poem and she wrote me one too about being each other’s safe space and how we want to grow with each other. I had skepticism early on because she was younger but she spoke as though she was very mature and would easily answer or support me when I had any doubt or insecurities. She only lived a couple hours away and I told her I wanted to take her on a date soon and she was happy to hear that and wanted the same, she even offered to meet me half way. I declined and said I thought it be important if her family met me since I don’t want them thinking she’s just going out with a stranger. Well last night I wanted to send her something so I asked for her address, I sent her flowers and I guess her mom/brother lost it because she gave a stranger their address. She said she would smooth things over with them, I guess she kind of did but her mom asked for my DL ID so I sent it. After a gruesome hour of waiting for a reply she apologized for the delay and then just told me this whole relationship was “inappropriate” and that it would be best if we “went our separate way for now”, which crushed me. I’m in this weird state now and I don’t know what to do. I just replied with an apology and just said I understood. I wrote her another poem but idk if I should even send it.

Ex stalking socials despite being the one dumping me?,"It's been 10 months since we broke up, she ""seems"" to be doing well and is a lot more outgoing than I am. I'm getting there, although it's not the best, I'm hanging on. Made new friends, picked up new hobbies and busy with university and the gym. We had some rough 9-10 day reconnection 6 months ago after our 4 month no contact period directly after the break up. We also last spoke during March. Both time periods did not end well whatsoever. Like her past patterns, she continues to vilify me, twists the narrative, leaked personal info of me to her friends then twists it and spreads information about me which are blatantly false.

Last month I woke up to an instagram notification from her, it was her requesting to follow me. I click on the notification because I was obviously stunned and confused, only for the request to be gone. I dwelled on it for a few hours of course before shrugging it off. Fast forward till now, 2 days ago I also got a notification from her on tik tok, that she viewed my profile. I wasn't even sure it was her at first till I went onto the account which confirmed her identity. Her reposts are pretty much just ""self love"", loving her best friend, couple tik toks and all that bullshit to be honest.

Despite being the one who abruptly dumped me and even acknowledging being the ""asshole"" or ""villain"", I've noticed that i'm always hearing/seeing something from her in some way within a burst of every 2-3 months. Never beyond the 4 months where I hear nothing.

Also, the reason I didn't block her was because during the time it was easier for me to spiral since she was a lot more accessible towards me from a few buttons away.

I'm not sure what's happening nor why she's exactly doing this other than a brief assumption. Do I confront her the next time she does it with evidence so she won't have the ability to gaslight me or do I continue being silent?

I realized 18m is taken (but is gay or bi idk) so I stopped talking to him. He asked why am I not talking anymore I just said I'm stressed (which is true because my mom has breast cancer and he knows) so I started ignoring (at first when I found out he was taken) and he asked do you hate me I said no. He did a lot of toxic stuff (if you look at some posts in my profile there's more details) my friends and sister said he's a asshole and I gotta ignore him. I let 22m know (im not talking to him because he did something I disliked and that made me uncomfortable using his training on me and giving me much more anxiety) because we used to be a trio of friends. 18m is also getting cocky because he's becoming a shift manager and I'll have to talk too him anyway when he finally becomes shift manager. He put me down a lot but we have some similarities. I feel really guilty and sad for ignoring him because work isn't fun without him. I also feel lonely because 22m is my only friend now. Has anybody gone through something like this? If you have any advice please answer (and I don't know all this crap about me liking someone on the job. If I'm with someone a lot sometimes you feel something it happens) I wanna tell 22m but he's having a mental health week because someone gave him permission to and he's gonna be resting and with his gf f26. I encouraged him a lot when he said he was taking the break so I gotta wait. Me and 18m only like night shifts so we're gonna se each other a lot anyway no matter what.

I can't let go... She is very decided to not back down,"Hello all,

It's been about 2 months since my (37m) wife (10 year together 4 of those with a kid) asked me for separation with sights set on divorce.

I have had ""the talk"" about 5-8 times now. Her message is clear: ""the last 4 years of parenting have created a ridge and eroded our relationship to a point I don't feel anything romantic for you and to some extent just know that we are too incompatible to work. I don't feel you do me good and I am still at an age (35y) to turn my life around and look for happiness elsewhere. I have many personal issues I need to work on and I just can't do them with you. I feel unable to put any effort into this relationship and just want to leave""

She is not wrong... These last 4 years (same time as my kid age) really made us loose all touch and both of us showed the other the worst version of each other. Added to her calling for separation... She had an emotional affair last year that almost made us separate. But sadly even though we did rekindle for a while... We stayed stuck in the status quo of just being parents and not looking out for our relationship.

From my part I am devastated... I am not blindsided by her decision but I always thought there would be a ""I am considering divorce.. please let us do something before we get there"" moment... But there just wasn't...

We still have to live together due to complex financial reasons (she just recently got a job after a 1 year hiatus to do therapy after her affair, we live in a house we bought and moved into 8 months ago...) so I have seen her literally emotional detach before and even worst after (she texted some guy constantly....)

I feel stuck... Every time i think I am getting better... I see her again or have a nice family moment (which we have because again we still live together) and I just can't imagine my life and my family without her.
I have begged, I have acknowledged all our mistakes and proposed that we can try to define our relationship as ever we want to make it work (open the relationship has even been said)

The worst part is that I am not sure why I am doing all of this... My wife has been very conflictive and I remember being somewhat miserable from time to time for how she treated me... But I just believe that what we are going through is going to make us both better people and I just HATE the idea of not profiting from that side of her.

I am obsessed with her... I find her super attractive, I love the way she loves my kid and I just can't stop thinking about wanting to share all nice and bad moments with her

I obviously feel my real turning point will be when she moves out... But I still feel that even then I will be reminiscing about the family that I lost for eternity 

I am doing therapy, getting in shape and spending more time with my kid. But I feel so empty when doing these things... I just cant get over the idea that we did not really try to salvage our relationship... We just functioned as parents and I am infatuated with some version of that can make it work and be happy ",1,0,2025-06-29 15:40:05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnhpav/i_cant_let_go_she_is_very_decided_to_not_back_down/,,,
"When did you realize they weren't coming back, and how did you cope?","For context, all of my previous exes and situationships came back. All of them. Some to have another go at the relationship after ~6 months no contact. Some simply to apologize or to clear their conscience. But they all reached out to me after shorter or longer periods of silence, for one reason or another.

This relationship, if I could call it that - feels different. After 3 months of silence, I am coming to the realization that he will never try to reach out to me again. He strung me along for 8 months, treating me like crap, under the excuse that ""he's been hurt in the past, trying to open up, needs more time"" etc. I'll spare the details, cause it's embarrassing to even think about how I allowed this man to treat me, but buttom line is, he never cared about me. His actions proved this to me over and over again, I just failed to accept this for the longest time, because I was in love, and wanted to believe that he cared, because he said he did. Typical.

We went no contact 3 months ago. He passively breadcrumbed me during that time - stopped watching my stories, then started watching them again, even rewatching them at times. I kept on waiting, and hoping, and praying he would reach out. But he didn't, and I ended up removing him off everywhere, to preserve my sanity... Yet I still held out hope he would message. 

A few days ago was my 30th birthday. He didn't reach out. That's when the final realization set in - he NEVER CARED. He couldn't stand being held accountable, even at times when I would gently bring up that he was hurting me. Of course he will never reach back out. He would have to face the damage he's done, and he never cared about me enough to do that. That's just how this story ends. There will be no closure, like the kind I've received in all of my previous relationships. And I somehow have to be okay with that, and find it in me to let go and move forward. 

In cases like this, how do you cope with the fact that the story is just over? I feel paralyzed at the thought that those 8 months of my life are just... gone without any meaning... The pain of never getting any closure from the person I cared about so much feels unbearable..

If anything, it’s more embarrassing for them that they weren’t kind to you. Not being upfront is a reflection on him, not you at all.   What’s made me feel slightly better is remembering these people will never change. The next person will have to deal with the same thing.   I think those 8 months were important because it will help you finding what you do or don’t want in a future partner, which I’m sure you will as you sound like you have so much love to give.   I’m trying to get over something very similar and I had the same excuses as you did for 2 and a half years. Honestly, it was really hard not to think of it as a waste of time but I also recognised that while she wasn’t very nice to me, I did really love her and  I’m glad I got to experience that. in the future, i know it’ll be easier to walk away from something like that a lot earlier on. Part of me was also waiting for a closure text but then I realised the way she acted had made it clear she didn’t care. I think with people like that we have to keep living and moving in silence away from them because they feed off the loyalty & unconditional love we provided them. That doesn’t mean they won’t feel it at a later point but when they do come crawling back (it’s always when you least expect it) it’s to get their needs filled again so I’m proud of you for deleting him. It shows how strong you are closing that door.   I keep thinking it’s better to feel like this now than to be in the same situation next year. Take it from me, the more time you’re in it the more miserable you are and the more your self worth declines. There’s loads of wonderful people who will make an effort for you and I really hope you’re ok ❤️ ||| You realized they weren’t coming back when the silence wasn’t just quiet—it was deafening. When they stopped even pretending to care, that’s your sign. The breadcrumbs, the watching stories, it’s just noise meant to keep you hooked.  Closure from them? Forget it. Sometimes people walk away without a word, no explanation, no apology. You don’t get that. You make your own closure. You own your story, the lessons, the growth, not the heartbreak they left behind.  Those 8 months aren’t gone. They taught you what you don’t want and who you need to be. That’s meaning right there. It’s not wasted time if you let it shape you.  Coping means accepting the ugly truth, not waiting on a fantasy. Feel the pain, but don’t drown in it. Build your peace without their permission. You move forward because you have to—not because they made it easy. That’s how you win. ||| Sounds like he was a confused little boy wavering on his decision. Wavering on what he wants vs what he needs vs the world’s expectation of him.   And if you accept him back, he’ll likely still be that child waiting for someone to tell him what to do because he doesn’t know himself enough to ask or do what we wants.  We gotta move on, girl. Maybe he’ll heal before the next woman but we can’t do this to ourselves. They gave up on us. ||| For me i just assume it from the start. It hurts a lot but it's better than keeping hope for a few months and then realising they aren't coming back. Feels like you restart your healing ||| As painful as an ending is, you gotta look at the 8 months and take some lessons about yourself away from it. What you want, don’t want, how you behaved, what the dynamic was. Learning about yourself is a lifelong pursuit and never a waste kf time… as long as you use it to propel yourself forward and not get stuck feeling angry and bitter and blaming others. Sometimes two peope can have good intentions but the dynamic just doesn’t work. That’s the conclusion I am coming to about my own recent break up. The love never was lost and we still love eachother but we’re not right for eachother either. He’s not coming back. ||| I feel like I could have written this myself, only I’m in a different place in my journey. I used to cry and be upset over how he didn’t care. How he would stonewall me, lie to me, be inconsiderate to what was important in my life. When I read back on old texts, the gaslighting was so bright I’m surprised I can still see. He couldn’t take accountability unless I initiated an apology even when he was blatantly in the wrong. I’ll also spare all the details. But, what has helped me through is flipping the story. Why am I wallowing over someone who didn’t care? Why am I wasting precious days and hours overthinking it? Fuck him! Why do I want to cry over someone like that? I heard a good quote recently. “I’d rather lose him than lose myself”. Find someone who has the same capability as you to love someone new, even if they’ve been hurt by someone from their past. Don’t depend on that asshat for your closure. You make peace with it and make your own closure. Force yourself to start living life and improving yourself while remembering that your self worth isn’t dependent on him. ||| Wish i could tell you that it gets better. It doesn’t. And it fucking hurts 💔 ||| It takes up to 6 months for avoidants to start missing you. It's always when you start feeling really healed...and then BAM! They reach out and set off the craziness all over again. One of my exes waited over a year and said he missed me and regretted hurting me blah blah blah. Your closure is your freedom. These people rarely if ever change and you deserve better 💗 ||| The only way to truly get over someone is to stop having any feelings towards them, even if it’s anger and not love. The bottom line is that even if he came back and apologized he will treat you the same no matter what you do, so waiting for an apology is useless. I would block him so any attempts to reach out are futile.  I wouldn’t say that the time you spent together was useless however. You said it yourself- you can’t believe how you let him treat you. Which means you learned to never accept that type of behavior from any partner in the future. I went through the same recently, got treated badly by my ex because he was my first boyfriend and I didn’t know what to expect. And I’m honestly glad for the whole experience because now I know that I will never be with anyone who treats me that way again. I tried to villainize him for a while, but I realized that I will never get over him if I harbor any sort of feeling towards him.   I think the breakup and the way he treated you was enough closure. You deserve to be loved on your own terms, not based on someone else’s excuses. ||| when after a month her has not changed his mind and continues ti say the same thing. Prior to this id convince him not to leave because we needed him and he'd relent but this time is different he is not coming back no matter what. I won't ever see him again he moved 3 states away."
Idk how to handle this,"Has been 2 weeks since my ex and I broke up… 
M(23) F(18) 
She was a narcissist and gashlight me. 

We saw each other on Tuesday last week and talk but it wasn’t a lot! We had discussions and well at the end we end up doing the fun thing. And I ask her like how should I take this , she told me as something casual …..

I still have some belonging of hers and she has some of mine! We talk about seeing each others again on Thursday! 

(I know how bad she is, she play me , she’s fucking crazy I know) 

But my heart just wants answers and I know she is not gonna give me those! And well ofc I love and miss that person she showed me at the beginning……

On Thursday I call her asking what time we were meeting then she said she was busy! I told her brother I been waiting the whole day because i gave you the time to do this shit so I can move on! Then she told me well u need to understand stuff happens! (She was at home playing Xbox she didn’t wanna see me) 

Then very polite I told her look, idc what u do with you time but mine it’s important. And look I’m busy later today! Just lmk before Sunday! So we can do this! 

It’s Sunday, ha she hasn’t reach out or nothing it’s 9:34 how should I do this? Call her? Wait? Just forget about those things and that’s it! 

It’s so hard how a person can f*ck you up so bad, I was supper confident about my self, I liked to talk to new people , go out etc etc, I went to a job fair yesterday got panic and went out!

Do you really always love your first love?,I met my first love in August of 2021. I’ve loved her since the day I met her and in basically July of 2025 I still love her. We dated for about 10 months which I know isn’t long but we’ve been friends or trying to be more then friends basically since the day we met. It just doesn’t work out and she has a boyfriend now. On TikTok you see people talking about when they look down and the isle at their wedding and still the see the girl they loved when they were 16. I am 17 and I met my first love when I was 13 and I know that sounds stupid because at 13 you’re not mature enough to love someone that way but at 17 I know how I feel and I’ve felt this way since the day I’ve met her. I’m worried that I’ll be that person who still sees this girl when I’m looking at my future wife walking down the aisle. I love this girl so much and I’ve been trying everything to get over her but I just can’t. Can someone please tell me if you really never get over or never forget that first love,22,43,2025-06-28 23:05:34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmzy5i/do_you_really_always_love_your_first_love/,17.0,,"I think your first true love sticks with you your whole life even when you’re in love with someone else. I’d say first love becomes a part of who you are and never really leaves even if the relationship ends. ||| Yes. Me and my first love. Stopped communicating 12 years ago. Occasionally I still think of him. ||| I was with my soulmate for 3 years , we broke up may 19th 2025 . Can’t stop thinking about what I lost and how I could have changed it ||| Ye I feel that everytime I look at new girl I just look for her or just want them to be like her and when ever me and this girl make contact I get really happy for the short while we’re in contact hoping something more comes of it and it finally works then when it ends I end up hurt again ||| No lol. I don't. But I absolutely did for years. I do think you can properly move on. When I saw my ""first love"" last, I basically felt zero. Thinking about it I still feel zero. That fantasy can definitely leave your mind for sure! ||| No way lol.  Don’t even remember very well. ||| This post gmfu because my first love just broke up with me and we dated for eight years ||| I forgot completely. ||| There is always room for someone else in the future. It will become a fond memory into your adulthood and you won’t mourn it forever AS LONG as you don’t hold onto it like it’s the end all be all. You have to let yourself move forward and move on. No contact with them is best after these formative years, once you’re out of school it will become easier. You and her will both change so much even in the next 5 years or so that you won’t even recognize it anymore. You have to think about how much you’ve changed and that means they’ve changed as well, that version of them was just a moment in time and isn’t forever, and that’s OKAY! That’s what makes it so beautiful to look back on.  You don’t want to become one of those miserable people who is stuck on their high school relationship (respectfully) and carry it with you your whole life, it isn’t fair to yourself or your future partners. With time it will pass but you have to want to get past it. ||| I still cant tell ya cus my first love and I broke up 1 month ago and ofc i still remember her and miss her... (NC unfollowed & removed her from followers)  I take a bus everyday to the train from where I live, and I always like to chat with that bus drivers, he is a cool guy.. i told him she broke up with me and broke my heart. He said that he still remembers his first love (he is like in his late 40s or mid 50s) and he misses her cookings, and when he sees her he alwyas tells her that and asks for cookies and she give him lol...  I asked why they broke up he told me ""you dont wanna know what i did to her"" i asked ""cheated?"" He replied ""nah way worse""  Lol I dont wanna know or get into the details of that. But yeah he regrets it but he has a wife now ofc and lives his life but still remembers his first love wow!  That was... harsh to hear. I dont want to remember my first ever girlfriend. It ended so sadly! with me being a jerk and arguing and criticizing her and she got hurt. I hope she will forgive me some day even without telling me ❤️‍🩹"
Sex doesn’t feel the same,"Hey I’ve been picking up more people since the break up but nothing is good anymore I don’t get why. Is this like a common thing where sex isn’t good after a breakup.

It’s been two months ",2,4,2025-06-29 11:51:08,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnctnj/sex_doesnt_feel_the_same/,,,"Yeah it’s common.

Otherwise, it’s just physical sex. ||| Two months is so soon ||| Hi I will not  say that but after a breakup you  need to  have some good Sex to let the stress out"
The need to make them acknowledge what they did,"Hi, okay so I was with my boyfriend for 9 months. We were friends for 8 months before that. He was a typical nice guy. U can't expect him to hurt anyone. The thrill of going going from friends to more than friends was great, we had great chemistry, a great connection, loved each other's company- my boyfriend was my best friend. Amazing. (I should mention I had a great social life outside of this relationship too)

Now for the problems- he was not emotionally supportive and that's something I really needed in a  relationship. I needed reassurances (love language), to have someone check up on me randomly (he didn't even check up when I was going thru stuff or I was sick). But then we'd talk or meet and it would be great. That's why I let everything else slide. But there were times when his emotional negligence and dismissive behavior really really hurt me. While I voiced these things I was also really considerate about it as to not make him feel bad. We broke up and I told him all this and he said sorry but I still don't think he understands the actual extent of how hurt I was. In the last month of the relationship, I felt unloved and uncared for my the person I loved and cared for so much. 

The catch is while this was all going on, we broke up for different reasons (I'm moving countries). And I know while I have tried to voice as much as the hurt as I can I know if anyone asks him abt why he and I broke up he'd lead with oh our goals weren't aligning when in reality he hurt me so bad I couldnt bare being with him. He lacked emotional intelligence, emotional maturity and empathy to even make space for what I'm saying let alone trying to understand it. 

This stings me. I want his friends to know. I want him to acknowledge everything. 

Edit: To add to this, post break up i wanted to go no contact while he wanted to wean off, try to stay friends for a while. After a lot of back and forth, he got his way. I actually removed him from my Instagram and since we're still in contact on text l, I let him know that ""hey jbtw I removed u from insta, letting u know so there aren't any surprises"". He reacted really weirdly to this and told me he doesn't feel good and he ended up talking to me on call begging me to add him back because he wasn't ready. I budged, felt bad. After this we also engageg in things I should NOT have been engaging in with my ex, let alone an ex I was really hurt by. It was usually him initiating conversation but I was available all the time. The last time we talked was a month ago because he said this isn't healthy lol. And that's how it stopped. I felt stupid. 
 
I also want to mention I know this is unhealthy lol. I know this this coming from a place of low self esteem. The fact that I let so many things in the relationship slide was due to low self esteem, ppl pleasing tendencies, fear of abandonment. I then went ahead and bent my own rules and let him push my boundaries. So I take this relationship as a lesson. 

But my question is , how do I move on from the need for acknowledgement? Being available after the break up made every thing worse. Although It's been 3 months for the actual break up and I'm definitely in a much better place, my feelings for him have decreases too and I'm getting better. It's just this vengeful acknowledgement need that I can't shake off.  I know I can't control the narrative but I have to shake off that need to want to.

So, well after the breakup, I called her and told her.  I was very direct and somewhat mean about it.  It definitely stopped her breadcrumbing, but it also assured that she would never speak to me again and the memory she will carry of me is not a good one.  I feel guilty for this and I wish I had just shut everything down without having to hurt her.  I am not good with guilt and I have to carry guilt for my words.  It’s really best just to move on and keep your dignity."

"We used to kiss, cuddle, and be close. Around his friends, he pretended I didn't exist.","had a romantic connection with this guy. It wasn't casual we were physically, emotionally and intimate. that was until we went to a party and we were around his friends, everything shifted. He distanced himself, he embarrassed me, made fun of me to make his friends laugh and made it seem like he didn't know me even joked like I was some random girl. People were shipping us and he dismissed it so rudely, we were walking in a group and he made sure not to be seen beside me and told me to make new friends at the party because he didnt want to ""babysit"" me. Meanwhile, he was totally fine being playful and warm with other girls in front of them, he eventually left me alone by myself at the party and the night after he didn't want to send the selfies we took together but he was posting pictures of himself with other people but me, he was also happy to see everyone except me. he did everything in his power to avoid and dismiss like we didn't have a strong connection 

It was humiliating and confusing. I've never felt so dismissed by someone who once made me feel special. I'm left wondering: was he ashamed of me? Embarrassed? Why would someone flip like that in public?",1,1,2025-06-29 15:16:59,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnh5lc/we_used_to_kiss_cuddle_and_be_close_around_his/,,,"It's pretty clear that he sees you as just a casual hookup and that he expects you to wait patiently for him in the corner while he sets up other hookups.  If you're fine with that, then by all means go ahead and continue hanging out with him."
She cheated and I miss her ..,"She told me it was over on March 17. Said she found someone else who made her happy and that she wanted to be with him. At first I was stunned but I tried to respect her decision. What came after that wasn’t closure though. It was manipulation. She kept contacting me. Not always directly, but just enough to make it feel like the door wasn’t fully shut. Calls. Messages. Emotional bait. She didn’t act like someone who had let go. She acted like someone who still wanted to control the situation even if she was already gone.

Even after saying she had moved on, she kept guilt tripping me. On April 21 she said I violated her trust and humiliated her publicly. That I forced her to leave. She said I drained her bank account. That I used her. She made it sound like I was the one who broke her. But I never asked her for anything. Never took anything she didn’t offer. I didn’t lie. I didn’t play games. I was still trying to understand what happened and instead she flipped the entire story on me.

Then came April 25. She sent over 40 emails and messages that day. All over the place. One minute she’s calling me papi. Telling me she loves me. That she doesn’t want anyone else. Then she’s saying I never loved her. That I just used her. That I ruined her life and made her miss work. She said I broke her mentally and emotionally. Said I abandoned her. Then told me I could still fix it. That I was the one playing games. She said she was forced to give someone else a chance because I ignored her. But by then it was already too late. She had already slept with someone else. I found that out for sure on April 27 when I finally confronted her and said it out loud. All those messages she sent me after the breakup, all the emotions and guilt, were just a way to distract me from what she had already done. When I told her I knew, she didn’t deny it. She just went quiet.

She breadcrumbed me. Said it was over but kept tugging at my emotions like a string. She wanted to keep control. Keep the power. Keep me stuck. Every message was a mix of love, pain, blame, and shame. She used me emotionally right after cheating on me. And the worst part is she made it feel like I was the one who did something wrong. Like I failed her. But I didn’t. I was there. I was loyal. I was real.

Looking back now it’s clear. She didn’t want to be with me. She just didn’t want me moving on. She couldn’t handle losing the narrative. So every time I started to let go she’d send something just strong enough to pull me back in. But it was never about love. It was about control. She cheated. She lied. She rewrote the timeline. And she did it all while pretending to be the one who got hurt. It wasn’t heartbreak. It wasn’t confusion. It was betrayal.

The breakup didn’t break me. It revealed everything I had been ignoring.," used to think the hardest part of a breakup was the loss. The silence. The missing them. But what really hit me was realizing how much of myself I had lost while trying to keep someone who was never really choosing me in the first place.

I ignored red flags. I over-explained. I stayed even when I felt small. And when it ended, it hurt like hell but it also forced me to face everything I had been avoiding. That’s when I knew I didn’t just need to move on. I needed to heal.

I ended up writing a lot through that process and eventually created something called The Real Love Manual. It’s everything I wish someone had handed me in the middle of my spiral. It helped me understand why I stayed too long, why I confused anxiety with love, and how to stop repeating the same patterns.

If you’re in that weird place where you’re still hurting but starting to see things clearly — you’re not alone. And if you’re choosing peace this time instead of going back to what broke you, that’s real progress.

"I miss her so bad, hugging a gift brings me comfort","It's painful how much I miss her, a lot of it was my fault. A lack of understanding and not communicating, her making assumptions I didn't care/love her anymore(Which I do find baffling tbh, would a guy really not love you if he got 50+ bucks worth of flowers for you? It was long distance so it was never about getting her to undress. I was showing my appreciation and love for her) since she couldn't see progress I was making on closing the distance, and at some point she must have said/done something to make me think she wanted to stay in her state so the whole saving up thing took longer since it's a pricier area/state and I simply didn't want us to fight over money as her retail job went straight to college.

I know now that me lashing out during the ""Just friends"" phase at the end was Separation Anxiety disorder, my therapist told me and looking back at our last week of communication I was on edge and constantly quick to reach out and calm her down or reassure her if she texted me about being down. And the second she said she didn't think we should get back together at all anymore, that's what broke me. I've been on edge for weeks, missing her and our love. I miss our texts, her laugh, her beautiful smile....

I know now why I lashed out and it sucks she'll never forgive me or know how important she truly is to me, even now. You don't get that over somebody you don't care about and she never told me she felt distance or unloved. A little communication on both our parts would have fixed things.

I still have the stuff she's given me over the years, hugging the Stitch blanket she bought me always brought me comfort even while we were together. Whenever she was at work or out with friends/family and I couldn't get a text/call, I'd reach out for the blanket and feel comfortable.

"Récent and painful breakup, any advices ?","Hello everyone, first let me say that this subreddit has helped me a lot these last 2 weeks. Also, sorry for my bad English.

I (24M) and my ex (24F) recently broke up. 
We were together for 1 years and it was beautiful. She had a very painful relation before me and I was single for several years.
I had lots of family issues in my life and it was really hard the last 3/4 months and it really affected our relationship. I was not emotionally available and that’s what was lacking in here previous relationship. 
We talked about this and I said stuff that you should not said to anyone except a psy. 
I was in a lot a of pain, feeling empty etc. 
The last weeks before the break up our couple was weakening. We were seeing each other less and less and things were already on the wrong path. 

On the 10th June she wanted to talk, and announced that she wanted us to make a break. To heal ourselves and get better etc. 
It was so hard… we talked a little bit. She came to take her stuff from my apartment, we hug and cried and I felt love in here hug (she was the one to ask for it). Then she left. 
Several days later I told her I wanted to see here just to talk because… damn we needed to talk instead of avoid each other. She said she agree and wanted to see me and talk about us. 

But the next day she said it was over and I needed to get over her, like we needed to forget each other to heal and get better. Then she blocked me on everything…it destroyed me for real. I love her and she just take my right to talk, to explain. 
It was one week ago. 
I saw here two days ago at a bar with her colleagues and it seemed painful for her, it was painful for me. 
I know I should forget her but damn… I don’t know. We are in the same city and next year we will begin a phd in the same field, in the same labo, we will leave in the same neighborhood etc. I can’t believe it’s over. I don’t to contact her anymore. She has to come by herself but in 1 or 2 months I think about sending here a letter just to explain how a felt etc. 

In my opinion we have so much to write, it can’t be over. If you have advice or similar stories feel free to share. 
Thanks to all of you. ",1,2,2025-06-29 15:01:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lngs2d/récent_and_painful_breakup_any_advices/,,1 year(s),
reacting “too well”,"My girlfriend and I just broke up yesterday. I really did think she was the one. I had a whole future planned out with her and I don’t think anyone matched me quite the same way she did. But compared to other breakups I’m handling this “well” 

My past relationships were toxic and I was definitely experiencing a much harder point in my life so I think those breakups shook me more. I’m just scared it’s all gonna hit me like a truck and I won’t know what to do.

If you need someone to talk to, I’m open to hear you out. Having your whole future planned out because she is the one is something I completely understand. My ex broke up with me and I believe, and still do, that she is the one.  At first, you will feel denial. Like this isn’t what is actually happening. After a couple days, a week, or more, it will hit you like a truck. I can definitely be there for you if you’d like.  It is normal to not feel distressed enough. That is the denial phase. You will feel it hit you hard once you move onto the next stage. ||| Your brain is more accustomed to the protocol now, so it is better equipped to regulate your emotions.  The heartbreak WILL show up eventually, but it won't be as bad."
really struggling right now,"recently (2 months ago) my partner of 17 years told it's over

at first I was in denial, oddly mixed with acceptance. The last 2 weeks however have been straight up depression with a strong hint of denial. I can't stop thinking of her. 

What makes it harder is I see her 6 days a week, albeit briefly, as we have a son and I have him after school and on sundays

Communication has been jovial, she even lol's and puts in laughing emojis in some of her messages

following the breakup, I moved into a flat with a friend of mine who has a spare room, so I haven't been on my own. But this weekend I've been house sitting my dad and stepmum's place, and this is my first time actually been alone. And they have a shitload of family photos all over the house. There are some particularly nice ones of me and my ex with our son that were taken by a professional photographer. One photo is the one I've had in my wallet for the last 8 years, of her and our (at the time 1 year old) son in the most loving cuddle you've ever seen

She dropped my boy off yesterday morning, which stirred up feelings when I saw her, but I've been able to focus all my attention on my son.

Until about an hour ago when she came to pick him up. 

While he was gathering his stuff, my ex and I were just chatting away like old times. And my god she looks good. 

She even said bye to me as she left, which she hasn't actually said any time she's picked him up all the other times

Now I'm back to been on my own in this house. I'm struggling immensely not to message her to tell her how much I miss her. I'm fighting back the tears.

I have a very good friend who is always quick to respond when I message him, actually I'm about to go around to hang out with him because I cant handle been on my own right now. I'm not thinking of doing anything stupid, I just cant deal with been alone

I miss her so much. God I miss her so much",4,2,2025-06-29 07:08:41,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln8i7d/really_struggling_right_now/,,,"Firstly, I’m so sorry to hear this. Ending a LTR is so difficult. I really can’t comment on the breakup itself because you haven’t given any details - which is fine. But just know that so many people are going through something similar. This is a time right now to love yourself. Be really kind to yourself. I know you miss her, but really it is your nervous system missing its safety blanket. That blanket needs to be you now - at least for the time being, who knows the future. But for now, take it one day at a time. Do the basics. Eat food. Sleep properly. Drink water. Call friends. Go for a walk. I suggest not to be on your own right now. Then, you can take stock and decide if you really are supposed to be together or not. Stay strong brother."

I messed up and I regret it so much i’m,"I (22M) got dumped by my ex (21F) about two weeks ago. We dated 3 and a half years and we were each other’s first for everything. We even planned our future together. 

I messed up really bad and I threw it all away. I broke her trust multiple times, mostly around boundaries involving other girls. I lied when i shouldn’t have and she forgave more than once too. Each time I said I would change, but I didn’t and I hate myself for that. Now it’s too late for that. I hate that I caused her this pain. 

She broke up with me a little over a month ago and I fought for her. I left a note and flowers for her by her door every day. And she was willing to give it another try after texting me and asking to meet up. This time I was willing to change and to not repeat those past mistakes. I thought things were going well until 2 weeks ago. She wanted to break up with me again. She said that she couldn’t get over the hurt that I caused her and that she thinks she rushed back into this relationship. She asked for no contact and I broke it within a week. It made me realize reaching out will cause more harm than good so I haven’t reached out to her since.

There was no hate in the end, there was no screaming match. We both still love and care for each other, but she can’t get over the fact that I did what I did to hurt her. I regret it so much for hurting her this much. We both decided to go no contact for the meantime and if we were truly meant to be, we would find our way back to each other. We both agreed upon a date (February 16th, 2026) to meet at the place where we had our first date. If only of us shows up, then we will know where the other stands. If we both show up, we can at least talk and go from there.

I just can’t stop thinking about her and the no contact is killing me. I’ve been trying to keep myself busy with bettering myself and growing as a person. I’ve been going to therapy, working out, journaling, and doing a lot of self reflection on the kind of man I want to be. But I just wish she was here to see it. It just feels so lonely without her. I want to reach out, but I know I shouldn’t. I hate this feeling I have in my heart every single day. I can hardly sleep or eat. I just want her in my arms.",2,3,2025-06-29 10:39:13,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnbmvg/i_messed_up_and_i_regret_it_so_much_im/,,,"I 100% feel you man.

I hope you become better if you really want to get her. Partner's loyalty is the biggest treasure in this era which is rare to find. If you break that loyalty and trust, you are ruining your partner's beliefs too. But also it is a fact that you chose to mess up. It is always our choice. Maybe you didn't love her enough and just loved how she treated you. And you feeling the pain cz you know that nobody else is gonna be that loyal and nice to you. You are missing her cz she was a great partner and not you. So if you ever think that you can't match her loyalty, please leave her forever for her good."
How can I stop dreaming? (Rant),"Its been a month since I left her and I still feel so dead inside and empty. I've been dreaming of her too. Both good and bad. Last night we were happy again, fufilled. Having fun, laughing. I woke up and hated myself a little more. Ive been hating myself a lot lately. I just wish I could fall asleep without dreaming of her. Everyone says ill get over it and meet someone new, but I dont believe it. Im losing connection with everyone. Im losing my friends, im losing my mind. Everyone is annoyed by my constant sadness.

Struggling with blindsided breakup,"I'm really struggling to make sense of what's happened, and I just need a place to let it out.

I was in a relationship for 8 months with someone who I genuinely believed was serious about me. When we first started dating, he was incredibly full-on, constantly calling, texting, saying he’d never felt a connection like this before. He told me he loved me early on, he met my family 4 months in, introduced me to his kids and family 6 months in and we constantly talked about our future, even moving in together.

He had been broken up with his ex for 4 months when we met. He told me she had emotionally cheated, that she’d reported him to the police during a heated argument (which was dropped), and that their relationship was toxic. He painted her as manipulative, emotionally damaging, and someone he wanted nothing to do with. He said she ruined him, reassured me that he had no feelings left for her and that he was ready to move forward. He told me I was the person he saw his future with.

Naturally, I had some doubts throughout the 8 months, especially because he brought her up constantly. I was honest with him about how that made me feel and he always reassured me that he was over it. I chose to believe him and I worked through those doubts with him. We got on really well, felt very comfortable with eachother, he was warm, affectionate, he was my best friend. I felt safe with him.

Then out of nowhere, 1 week ago, he ended things over text saying he wasn't emotionally ready to give me what I need, that he needed to be alone to deal with his emotions and heal from the damage his ex had caused. He said he was still in love with his ex and needed to work on that. He also said he ""still wanted me in his life but couldn't give me 100%"". I tried to call, to understand what had happened but he ignored me. He completely cut me off and instantly removed me from all social media. I was left completely blindsided and heartbroken. I couldn’t and still can't make sense of how someone who said they loved me and was planning a life with me could just switch off like that. How you can talk to someone everyday for 8 months, say you love someone and want to be with them forever and then suddenly disappear? There were no signs, he was even acting normal the day before when I saw him.

And now, I’ve found out he’s back with his ex, which I'm pretty sure happened the same day he brokeup with me. The same ex he swore he was done with, the same ex he said he’d never forgive or get back with. I feel like I was lied to the entire time, like I was just a placeholder while he waited for her to take him back. And now, everything he said to me, all the I love yous, the future talk, the promises feel like lies, like I never really mattered.

I’m trying to cope but the betrayal is so crushing. I’ve been stuck in my head replaying everything, trying to figure out what was real and what wasn’t. I gave him so much of myself, stood by him during his hardest moments, and he just disappeared and ran back to the person he claimed hurt him the most.

I guess I’m just struggling to process it all. How can someone say all those things, do all those things and then blindside you like that?

Thanks for reading if you got this far. I’m just trying to make sense of it all and figure out how to move forward.",3,2,2025-06-29 08:18:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln9jbw/struggling_with_blindsided_breakup/,,8 month(s),"I am so sorry you are going through this. I'll be honest with you, you were the rebound to make his ex jealous to win her back. I'm not saying he didn't genuinely like you, but he was not healed and ready for a new relationship after he broke up. He rushed into something new to try and get over his ex, validate his ego that he could get someone else and used that as a way to show his ex that he was able to get other woman so she would want him back. These type of people love bomb heavy at the start of a relationship. Most of the time, the second go at a relationship doesn't work out. Don't take him back again if his relationship with her fails. He showed you exactley who he is. As much as it hurts, go no contact and never let this guy back into your life. Heal from it and learn from it. Being blindsided hurts bad, I know. Don't take it as a reflection of your self worth, this is all on him and he was unhealed. Move forward with self respect and never contact this person again if they reach out. I am so sorry this happened to you. ||| My ex just did exactly the same thing. She lied to me throughout saying she hated her ex and he was a narcissist and she was so happy to have me as nobody had treated her as well as I had. I asked her multiple times if she was over everything she’d been through and she told me she was like I was silly for asking. She then discarded me over text and refused to speak to me or explain beyond simple reasons, days later I see she’s back in contact with her ex again.

I know what I had to do but I just wanted him to understand that I needed him to step up too. Maybe I wasn’t clear in our post breakup chat because of high emotions, maybe everything came off as excuses/reasons, idk.

Long distance ghosting / blocked,"

I talked to a girl for almost two months. We FaceTimed nearly every day and got emotionally close. We opened up to each other, shared personal stories, made each other laugh, and talked about what it would be like to finally meet in person. She lives in Vancouver, and I live in Calgary. Eventually, we made a plan for me to visit her. She invited me to stay at her house, and just two days before my flight, we confirmed everything. We even had a call to go over expectations and rules for staying at her place. She told me about a restaurant she wanted to take me to. She also told her parents and her sister about me, and her sister even saw me on FaceTime. We made a detailed schedule for the trip, and about a week before my flight, she told me she missed me and that she couldn’t wait to see me.

Originally, I planned to stay for a full week, but after she said her feelings had changed just four hours before my flight, and told me I couldn’t stay at her house no matter what, I changed my flight and paid for a new ticket to return home early. I stayed only four days instead of the week we had planned.

She had hours even days  to tell me sooner, but she waited until the last possible moment. I was shocked, but I still got on the plane, thinking maybe we could talk or figure things out in person. But when I landed in Vancouver, she ghosted me completely. Shortly after, she blocked me on everything my number, my social media, every way to reach her. She knew exactly when my flight landed, and she chose to cut me off right after I arrived, knowing I had nowhere else to go.

I can’t help but feel like there may have been someone else involved. She said a “friend” was over the night before, and her entire energy shifted out of nowhere. After two months of closeness, daily conversations, and confirmed plans, she left me completely alone in a new city without explanation or closure. She didn’t just change her mind  she waited until it would hurt the most. That’s not confusion. That’s deliberate. That’s not how you treat someone who cared about you. And that’s something I’ll never forget.

I feel insane,"Officially 1 week and 1 day out of the 6 year relationship but it was a month of being on the rocks.
Other than that month, we were okay.

We had our ups and downs. I struggled with intimacy.
I can see now that there were things we needed to sort out.

I just never ever thought we would break up.

Unfortunately I am living in his home house with him and his dad. I have a bed to sleep in and bathroom but do not access the kitchen. In his room, it's all our things. Photos, momentos. It hurts.

I still have access to his Netflix, Disney etc. Sometimes I check to see if he is watching anything.
If he's watching something, maybe he is trying to drown out his thoughts and deep down is conflicted about ending it.
If he's not watching something, I'm stalking his social media to see what he is up to, to see if he has moved on.

I feel insane. I have no one to talk to. I have no lust for life anymore. I never imagined a future without him.",1,0,2025-06-29 14:04:04,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnfgql/i_feel_insane/,,,

If the relationship was real and passionate (not necessarily “healthy” ) and evoked strong feelings I think most men consider coming back. Whether they do or not depends on a multitude of factors. ||| As a man myself, boy or man. We sometimes don’t show how we feel as that’s what we do. We bottle things in, don’t show much and I do that because it makes the other person worry less if they are watching or see me. We simply don’t express more than what we want too, just focus on ourselves and get better whilst our mind is going crazy and bouncing around. Every single person regrets breaking up, maybe some don’t realize what they lost until days, weeks or months after. It don’t come flushing forward.

But I’m sure others have and share differently. ||| I broke up with my ex 4 months ago because she was very vague in what she was saying.

She told me you broke up with me, now deal with it ||| I've never broken with anybody, they're the one who broke up with me ||| I broke up with my girlfriend last night, and yes I feel overwhelming regret, grief and sadness. ||| Good question. I felt resentment the last months for various reasons that caused me not to see her bright side. How valuable was what we had. What we built. But she pushed me to the edge.   Sometimes it pops up what could I have done differently, but I rationalise those thoughts quickly.    She said multiple times that it would be sad if we broke up. And it really fucking is. She wanted to marry me, but I can't build a life with someone who can't even take responsibility for the tiniest things. And you may wonder, yes, I tried to help, I stood beside her until we drove each other insane.   So, do I feel regret? I regret we couldn't fix things, but at that time and space that toxic relationship had to end. ||| Yeah I did. And honestly I still do in some ways.  Not because I think we could’ve made it work but because part of me still wonders if it could’ve gone differently. I’ve caught myself going back through messages piecing together timelines trying to understand what was real and what was just noise. That doesn’t come from indifference. That comes from someone who cared maybe too much. There were moments I just wanted to hold her again but right next to that was the fear of being played of repeating the same cycle. That push pull messed me up. I wasn’t just walking away from a person. I was walking away from the hope I had in her. I’ve asked myself everything Did she really care Was I being manipulated Was it love or just convenience You don’t ask those things unless you’re still carrying it with you.So yeah I regret it not because it ended but because of how it ended. Because of what it turned me into. Because I had to force myself to walk when my heart wanted to stay.  Hope that answers it. ||| yes, some do regret it   but a lot don’t process it like you think  he might be suppressing it   he might be relieved   he might be numb   he might feel it months from now when it’s too late  but what matters more is: *why are you watching for his regret instead of owning your next move?*  heal for you   not to get a reaction ||| Yes. Dammit yes.  But the egg cannot be un-scrambled. But had I been less impulsive, more wait-and-see, maybe it would have been a little different.  maybe she would have overcome her avoidance and the love would have deepened...maybe.  I'll never know now."
Processing a partner who needs space and no contact,"Just this last week me (21M) and my partner (21F) of 2.5 years separated and the part that hurts most is the lack of clarity and the fact she lives right down the hall in my apartment.

The few days afterwards, we still communicated and had some long discussions over the phone and one in person discussing what went wrong and how she was hurt by me. I gave her my final thoughts on why we could work together but she said she needed time to process all the things we discussed and asked for no contact while she does this. I know she’s hurting too because even a few days after we separated she told me she still hasn’t told her family or friends we broke up yet


Part of the pain is she told me outright she still loves me and went through the scenario of what she would need “hypothetically” if we got back together, which is just making it worse since it seems like she can’t just give me a clean answer and says this “hypothetical” scenario is to help her rationalize things. For a while on our 4 hour phone call she seemed to calm down with me and I even laughed with her a few times, making me briefly believe she was considering letting us try to work again.

I plan on honoring that no contact request no matter how hard it gets, and part of the struggle is she is going to a different university for one semester during the fall and mentioned she wanted to separate now because she believed long distance is too hard given our recent struggles. 

I really want to ask for a timeline but I know this is selfish of me and she has no answer and it’s not even guaranteed she will decide to ever get back to me with a clear answer. I have told myself its over and started the process of moving on, but this situation is still tugging at me when I know she’s just one message away and actively reflecting on whether she would want to try again with me in the future.",2,0,2025-06-29 10:16:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnbamz/processing_a_partner_who_needs_space_and_no/,,,

Should I go back to him?,"We've just broken up and I KNOW I'm stupid enough to be thinking that maybe we can fix our relationship again (EVEN AFTER BREAKING UP FOR 3 TIMES ALREADY) 

He tends to lust over my body (But I know it's ""normal"" if you are in a long distance relationship) He calls me dude. He always tells me to go find another man. He's emotionally weak to fix our relationship.

But I STILL LOVE HIM like crazy. I know I'm delusional for thinking he'll change but I don't know, I can't let go of him.

What should I do!??!",2,4,2025-06-29 09:59:27,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnb123/should_i_go_back_to_him/,,,"you and me are in the same boat except i guess me and my ex broke up twice. once mutually and last time one sided. i don't think you should go back to him right now... maybe in the future when things are different and stars align, a better relationship can grow. but i think you're obsessed with him right now and that'll stand in the way of having a good relationship. im saying this as someone who is still obsessed with her ex, but slowly accepting that i should let things go. ||| I feel like its normal to want that person to change and want to believe they can, but after 3 breakups and comments like “find another man”, I just don’t think it’s something you should pursue.  I know it sucks but it seems like if he’s had 3 chances now and still seems emotionally weak then he probably personally isn’t ready for a true relationship.  My girlfriend recently broke up with me and I have tried to take as much responsibility about things I did poorly and want to improve on those things and make serious changes to my life since it led to me losing my girlfriend. It sounds like if he wasn’t able to try and change after 3 breakups you should really try to avoid going back to him and stand your ground. It’s tough but he has to respect you for it like I respect my now ex for wanting to separate from me."
Stuck after a discard after 6 years together,"We broke up almost a year and a half ago. He ghosted me for a month after 6 years together, and then came back and said he didn't want to talk about it but it was over. He emotionally, financially and lifeplans-ally pulled the rug out from under me. I bought him out of the apartment, I rented it out and moved to a different city for a job and to get away. I found out he had been cheating and lying about it all through the relationship. I never cheated or lied. He had moved directly from our apartment into the new boyfriend's apartment. Kinda like he did with me and his ex before me. I should have seen it coming. It was not a great relationship, mutual mild abusive behaviour, but I loved him so deeply and him me and I genuinely trusted him. We had spent the last year building our home together while he was planning to leave. I was diagnosed with a mental breakdown when he left. I was also financially dependent on him and that's why I had to move city for a job. I felt banished from my life. I have no family to speak of except him. I am, diagnosed not just hyperbole, traumatised. 

So here's the problem. I'm still stuck in it. I still want him back. I still love him. I'm torn. I see the bad he did. I see the bad I did. What he did is unforgivable. But I want him to come to me and ask for forgiveness so that I can forgive him. I see all the good and bad in him. Wtf do I do? It's not going away. And yes I'm in therapy but can't afford as much as I need. ",1,0,2025-06-29 13:43:53,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnf0w6/stuck_after_a_discard_after_6_years_together/,,,
I thought we were forever. But the silence after was louder than any fight.,"Breakups aren’t always dramatic. Sometimes, it’s just a slow disconnect… until one day, you’re strangers.

"He needs ""space""","a little context: I am 42 F he was 35 M. He is an RN works Sun-Tues 3Pm-3AM (sometimes pulls a 16 shift) He has an almost 2 year old little boy which he has every other weekend. He also supports his dad (dad lives with him) Our relationship (or so I thought) was progressing well. He was communicative, made time for me when he didnt have his kid. I thought things were going well and I was super happy. 

So last Wednesday we were texting like normal. He was calling me honey and asking how my day at work was. A few hours later when I get home he calls me saying he needs his space. He doesn't feel like he can give me 100 and he feels pressured (even though I was not the one pressuring him on anything. I went with his flow and schedule because I knew he had other priorities) he said at my age I won't be able to have kids and that he feels pressure to move his timeline up because of me. He said he needed time to think asked me if I was okay with being in his son's life, moving in with him and his dad. Which is really an odd question to ask because we discussed all these things in the very beginning. if i weren't okay I wouldnt have stayed. I would have left. 

I was shocked and he asked if I had anything to say. I said No and we hung up. and I drank to numb the pain. I havent heard from him since. I won't text, I won't call. I won't beg. I blocked him on social because I don't want to see his face online while I am missing him and he's acting like I didn't exist. I deleted his number so I don't have the urge to drunk text him. Fast forward to yesterday (which was the weekend we were supposed to spend time together) I blocked his number. 

During our time together he said he's never met a girl like me. Caring, loyal, understanding. All his exes treated him poorly. Cheated on him, demasculated him. For the past week I tried to make sense of this. How he can go from hot to cold in a blink of an eye. Totally blindsided. But the more i think about it, the more hurt and sad i get. I am treating this ""space"" as a final breakup. Hurts like hell but if he wants to let me go, so be it. If he can't see my worth, his loss. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading and letting me vent in this community. Sending a virtual hug to those going through a breakup. It's rough. It;'s not easy, Stay strong.

My boyfriend and I broke up.,"My boyfriend (m17) and I (f18) broke up after 7 months. My ex boyfriend rarely showed his vulnerable side to me, it always he had this wall around him. He was not the type to show vulnerability and weakness, even around me.  

We broke up twice and I know it's not healthy but each time I thought that ""Maybe this time, we'll go back to how it used to."" But somehow we never went back to how it used to be. The first time it happened, it was an attempt– he said he was under a lot of stress because of some matters in his home but I told him that we can get by it. I stopped getting upset with him, stopped sulking, stop doing whatever girl's do with their boyfriend. I didn't want to add up to his stress. 

There was another attempt to break up with me when we were on a vacation abroad. He told me after a few days after his first attempt that I deserved better, that he was becoming toxic to me but as always, I told him ""No, I want you. I want to fix this"" 

Then the first break up happened. The reason why we broke up was because he said that I deserved better again and that he couldn't be better for me. I told him ""It's okay if you aren't better, I just don't want you to break up with me""  but he didn't fought and so we broke up.

The second break up happened after a two weeks again after we made up the same day we broke up but this time, we had this huge argument where our teacher said that ""Her mom isn't going to approve you."" She told me ""You deserve better. Don't go down from your status for him"" and it made him insecure which I understand and so he used the excuse college to break up with me.

3 days later, we got back and now.. we broke up again but not that he initiated it but I did. I understand that his love language was to be all touchy and clingy with my body but he was listing over it, to the point of me becoming an object to him. Whenever we called each other, he was like ""Can I see your..."" and told me that if we ever get married, I should get used to it because that's how a relationship last.

Then earlier today, he kept saying ""You should find someone else"", ""Your next boyfriend.."", ""You will eventually find someone else, you know."" That's when I got exhausted of us. 

I told him today ""Stop it. You don't have to force yourself to love me. You don't have to force yourself to need me, you can just leave. I know I was a bad person to you and I'm sorry. So now, you're free"" and he left. He replied to me with a simple message of ""Sorry for everything. Thanks for the 7 months, it was the best months of my life. Goodluck in college and take care, I love you.""

So where did it all went wrong? Why didn't he fight for our relationship? Why didn't he changed? I changed so much for him..

He used you only for your support without giving anything back. I don’t think this relationship “went wrong” anywhere tho. That version of him in the beginning wasn’t the real him it was his facade.

How can you tell if you're ready to date?,"I've been craving for comfort, intimacy, and love these days. I miss being held, hugged, and cherished. I love my friends and I hug them a lot when I see them, but I just want to be in a relationship so bad and feel butterflies and feel okay again. It's been 8 months since I broke up with my ex and ar first I thought I was okay; I didn't cry when we split up. I felt numb and sad, but I wasn't depressed—until last month. I started missing him again. I missed the way his hair smelled, the way he'd lovingly look at me, the way he'd hold me in his arms, and they way he'd compliment me all the time. I broke down and kept grieving our relationship. I feel guilty for grieving late and hurting him in the worst ways back then. We've talked a lot and had closure already. We're currently on good terms. After some time of thinking, I concluded that maybe I only miss him because I miss the love and comfort that he gave me. Is it safe to fall for someone at this rate? I've been giving myself so much love and I rewired my brain to be more positive, thoughtful, caring, and gentle. I feel like I want to love but at the same time I'm scared.

It’s hard to know when you’re ready but there are other markers to indicate if it’s a good idea to get back out there or not.   For me, it’s been three months and I’m very sure I don’t want to start dating right now. I need to heal and grieve. I need to confront all of my shortcomings and bad behaviours that caused the relationship to fizzle before I can be ready. And if I don’t take this time to correctly heal, I may just end up back where I am in the future  “One heart break leads to another”  -Lesley Gore  But I want it so bad again but I know if I do it right now, it’ll just be me using it as an escape from everything I should be dealing with.  Hope this helps ||| For me, that sounds like missing the past. Craving comfort. Being lonely. I think you know when you’re ready to move on when you meet the right person. Don’t date someone just to date someone. I guess another way to frame it is don’t jump into something just because you’re missing something, but rather to have your life added to if that makes sense. Don’t date just because you miss someone’s touch. Date when you find someone you want to spend time with. I don’t know if I am explaining myself well haha but I tried. ||| In my experience. I can tell myself if I am ready to date when I know that my ex deserves to be happy and it's better to split up. It's normal when I miss her because I just missed feeling happy and loved by her it's not a big deal. I suggest giving yourself a little time and you can finally date. ||| - When you know don’t have any lingering feelings towards your ex.   - When the idea of being with someone feels zealous, exciting and less of a cumbersome task  - You’re thorough with your boundaries, as in you have faith in yourself and your boundaries ; you have a well justified reason for all your no’s  - You know what you want and you’re simply not entering the game to fill in some void.   - Zero rejection sensitivity."
I Learned to Let Go,"After the breakup, I thought the pain would stay with me forever. But it didn’t. I gave myself time to heal, to understand, to recognize what was mine and what was just a wound. I found myself in the silence, in the solitude, in the tears that no longer begged for answers. I learned to be alone, but not empty. I let go of codependency—that need to be with someone to feel whole.

Yes, I still miss them sometimes. But not with longing—just as a memory. A beautiful one, but part of the past. I don’t want to go back. I wish them well, but from afar. I no longer care if they ever felt the same, because I now understand that what matters most is me.

To anyone going through heartbreak: return to yourself. Love yourself with patience. Learn to enjoy your own company. Because nothing—not even the love that feels eternal—is guaranteed to stay. But you are. You’ll always have yourself.

Still love my toxic ex,"We met through friends and lookokg back we definitely moved into the relationship way too fast but i definitely felt like i found my person. 

It was only 2 years, but not having her in my life has been chaotic.  We had our fights and disagreements but we were always able to hash it out and come together by the end of the day and be okay.  But then she started working,  which I was glad. Its no fun for her being stuck in the house all the time with her child.  Had her use my car to get back snd forth to work, I would just take the motorcycle even if it was too cold, wanted tk make sure she got to work you know.  Come to find out, shes been messing with a coworker....and what gets me is the week prior to me finding out she randomly stated "" I hope you won't give up on me"" 

Now after finding out, I packed. Moved all my belongings into storage and have been staying in my vehicle or at friends houses.  She messages me telling me that I abandoned her and her child. (I loved her little as she was my own and miss her terribly)

And of course after the break up I have her friends come to me telling me how she had taken my car to her exes house to have sex with him while I was at work....its brutal. Keep thinking about how she would look in my eyes and tell me how much I meant to her. But, was any of it even real. Was I just a place holder until she found someone who fit her better. The doubt and questions just dont stop.  And the fact the was able to cut me out so easily just makes me think I never really meant anything to her at all.

But 6 weeks later he’s with that girl now, even when i broke no contact after 3 weeks just to clarify it with him, in which he said there wasn’t anything between them. I believe that during those 3 days, he had already considered her, and he probably ended our 7-year relationship so it wouldn’t necessarily be considered cheating.

I don’t feel like myself anymore,"My ex broke up with me (I’m 19 for context) about a month ago it was only a few month long relationship but we were close friends before but things moved super fast I wasn’t perfect I was very anxious and probably overwhelming at times but he would say mean things about me like saying the fact I tried to kms when I was 16 was stupid , I’m pathetic because I fell off a bike , I’m like a dog on leash. 
He was the one who asked me out and called me his girlfriend in 2 days and told his mom about me right away and would always wanna cuddle , told me I’m so pretty , he could marry me , I make him feel at peace. 
He put in no effort but kept saying he needs time because he’s traumatized from a past relationship where his effort was ignored. It just kept going downhill he would insult me then say nice things then tell me i cry too much at one point told me if i cry again he won’t drive me to the airport (I was crying because it was our last day together for 3 months) , got upset I wouldn’t give him head and told me it would have sucked anyways. Blindsided broke up with me and then got back with me 30 minutes later. Then cried in my arms the next day because he’s such a bad boyfriend. 

He would constantly say things then go back on his word. Ex: “we’re so similar” the when he broke up with me “how are we similar”. He was Christian I’m not so I told him to rethink this relationship if he needs a Christian girl he said no I want to be with you then later it was “I can’t hurt a Christian girl”. I was always there for him he always had some issue I gave him advice , I drew for him I basically babied him he always go what he wanted.
We broke up because he needed to be alone and felt trapped and he didn’t like me enough anymore and he needs to go find a wife. This was all because I asked to come visit him for a few days over summer because he would only communicate with me through Fortnite or snap streaks Becasue texting and calling is too much. And we talked day after the break up and he asked why I was still sad?? It hurts because he dated me for my loving heart, knew he was my first everything , knew I was a hopeless romantic. And treated me so well as a friend he literally was gonna buy me a plane ticket.

Anyways , I feel like a shell of the girl I once was I’m so anxious and irritable all the time I don’t like ppl I don’t trust anyone anymore.

Ah she left after 22years and half our lives together,"After 22years together my fiance and i broke up a few months ago and yes i was a dafty chasing her but in my mind then it was worth it after so long together.

And i know most will say the same but we were a great solid couple until maybe the last year when she pulled away a bit but always blaming it on her hormones, menopause etc which i always supported her with and really didn't notice too much.  In some ways i was hoping she would get her head together after thinking she is 18 again, drinking more, snorting gear with the younger pals it was years since we done that stuff she is 44 and i am 46. Going out then the staying out then the gaslighting etc.

Since the break up i obviously chased as i was totally blindsided after the new year. We had built our lives together over two decades, on our 3rd home and her daughter, who i don't see any different we have raised her together and me since she was 3 and now almost 25. My fiance could not have anymore kids and i accepted that cos i would of never of abandoned them after almost ten years at that point and i was always happy. Our bond will never be broken i love my daughter  so much and at least she has my morals. Thru her cancer battles etc when she was 15 and very sick with a brain tumour but she made a full recovery. We have been through it all like most with our time together, Great holidays over the world and great times.

Anyway after the chasing we got back together 3 weeks ago after spending the last few months kinda together with sex and that and spending time together as i would be down to see my daughter and our two lovely dogs. When we were at the talking to get back together she said she had been on a few dates with someone 2 weeks after the split. But she assured me that was all it was and i was about to go on my first date even though i didt want too.

So we agreed no one was happy with the break up behavour even though she was awful to me we would bury it and move forward.

I had been suggesting moving back in on a trial basis for a few weeks but keeping all my stuff at my parents, she said no move back in and get all your stuff not half hearted and she would give me 100% if i matched it i was delighted this was the news i had been dreaming of for months finally coming home to my family.

Move my stuff back in and we have a great week in my opinion but obviously she felt different, out for dinners plenty of love and sex etc no arguments we never really argued much anyway .

Have a great friday nice meal and a few bottles of wine and dirty night. On the saturday i take the dogs out and she is running a bath and says she is going out for dinner with a friend. No big deal from me the football was on and i was happy in with dogs. She said ive put the engagement ring on  back after 4 months i was delighted and she kissed me goodbye and said she will be home in a few hours.Why did she do that too hurt me more? Never came back until sunday night at almost 10pm from saturday at 4pm. My bags were packed and before i left i said im staying until she in i want to hear this.

She admitted she was still seeing this guy and had been pumping both of us for months since the split i was broken and left. And she chose him that night and made her decision.

After 22 years she left for someone else. Now she is staying at his flat 5 days a week and says she loves him,the daughter is home with the dogs, Im in my dads with 9 bin bags of clothes after all that time.

I have a wee burd now and having some fun but i miss her so much and realise i can never have her back after all that.

She just carries on with no shame or gulit its a different lass now and she is drinking more an taking more drugs.

Im done with her and homeles at 46. Her behaviour and actions toward me this last few months have been awful, so disrespectful and basically treating me like a bit of shit on the end of her shoe. Not someone who u have been with almost half your life and been through so much from the amazing times to the bad times with our daughter not knowing if she would make it. She treats me like im insignificant really now .",7,2,2025-06-29 02:33:57,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln3yvn/ah_she_left_after_22years_and_half_our_lives/,,,Sounds like a complicated relationship.

What’s the point of being engaged if you don’t plan to marry?
"my ex keeps saying i didn’t “really” want to break up, and it’s messing with my head","i (19F) broke up with my ex (20M) a month ago after being together for three months. i was clear with him that im not in the right place for a relationship . i want to focus on myself and value my independence right now. he initially seemed to respect that, but now he’s been messaging me again.

he sent me a very long message about how he’s grown, how we’re “still compatible,” and that he’s changed from his clinginess. he also said things like:
	•	“i didn’t beg you to stay that night, even though i wanted to.”
	•	“maybe the part of you that wanted to break up wasn’t the real you.”
	•	“if your ‘speaker’ (the metaphor i used to try to explain to him my inner voice/trauma) was really your true self, you would’ve had the courage to leave your past relationships earlier.” (i explained to him lots of times why it was not easy to leave my past relationships)
	•	“so i guess i was just easier to walk away from.”

i know he’s hurting, and he’s not a bad 
person ,but it feels like he’s trying to invalidate my choice and make me second-guess myself. he keeps asking me to clarify why i broke up and saying maybe i was just traumatised, not actually wanting to end things.

im not planning on getting back together. but all of this has left me feeling confused and guilty. i can’t tell if im overreacting or not.

You wanted to focus on yourself and value your independence. You broke up with him.  Breakups happen and you did what was right for yourself. Your ex sounds weird, to put it lightly.   I would suggest blocking his number and blocking him on all social media. Relationships end for a variety of reasons. Even if you explain that you don’t want to be in a relationship anymore, he strikes me as the kind of guy who will keep pestering you until you give in. He’s not going to listen; he sounds like the “Nice Guy” on TV and movies who think they’re entitled to women.  Block him and protect your peace. He sounds really manipulative. You don’t need that in your life."
I don't think I miss my ex but I do miss some very small things that came with being with him f42 m36,"After some thought I decided I don't want to rekindle my relationship. It has run its course and there's no going back. What I miss is being in a relationship. I miss the little things you share when you're in a long-term committed relationship. I miss having dinner together, holding hands, talking and falling asleep on the couch. I miss having someone to welcome me home and ask about my day. I miss having somebody I can rely on or at least call for help. All these things have to be rebuilt and established through a whole new experience in a whole new person. I miss the comfort and familiarity of a boyfriend. Naturally I think of my ex when I think of these things but I no longer have longing feelings for him. It can be depressing to be around my ex because these moments are gone and we barely tolerate each other. The breakdown of relationship itself saddens me. It's quite the Dilemma. Relationships and people are important to me. I value family and friends. I miss the sense of security and stability of being in a relationship. A major part of my identity is made up of my relationships. For instance one part of my identity is being a mother that's important to me. My other was being significant other and caring for them. I do like to take care of the ones I love and it brings me great pleasure to do things for them that make them happy. I struggle being alone because I miss those little things. I have worked on myself and  I have hobbies I enjoy.  I find happiness in myself and my life. I just won't feel complete until I have my person. I don't need them but I do want them it matters to me. Does anybody else feel this way?

Losing my bestfriend,"My boyfriend of 2 years just broke up with me over us bickering and having small stupid arguments for the past month. I am 23 F and he’s 26 M. Over the past couple weeks we’ve been bickering over small things like disagreements, not answering the phone, differences etc. but I am the type of person to want to fix things and he is the type to ignore and hold grudges. I feel like he has been bottling in his grudges and finally after a small argument he decided to breakup. Something I thought was fixable he didn’t want to fix. This is the second time we breakup and I feel like I lost my best friend, he also said the same thing. This is really tough and hard because he is the only person in my life that I talk to I have no one else to talk to now and it’s going to feel weird and empty not being able to talk to him about everything and vice versa. I thought maybe distracting myself with dating apps would work to but I’m not ready at all. How do I cope and move on and how do I deal with this? It’s so hard not to call or text him either.",2,0,2025-06-29 09:06:04,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lna8i5/losing_my_bestfriend/,23.0,,

Are you hoping to get back together or do you simply just want closure for yourself? If it's simply for your closure, then I don't really see a reason why not to do it if you plan to move on after and not reconcile or anything.   If you are hoping for some kind of reconciliation, you might be better off waiting. I know four months seems like a long time, but they say a lot of people come back within 6 months can I sell it's not that unheard of that they would end everything out to you on their own. Now the reason that you might be doing that might not be for a good reason, but it could be an ego boost for you if they reach out on their own.  Only do this if you're totally okay with the outcome that they won't reply or they might respond angrily or say something that might really hurt you. If that's something that you can accept then I guess you can go ahead and do it. Especially if you don't want them anymore. If this is simply for your own self soothing a piece of mind.   Some people might say it's selfish but, I guess you can argue that it's selfish that they didn't give you closure. 🤷‍♀️ Whatever you decide to do, make sure you're okay with all possible outcomes. Not sending it means being okay with the fact that you might always wonder what if I did, there's also wondering what if they would have come on their own. If you don't care about those things, go ahead. ||| As someone who reached out looking for closure and ended up getting back together for a little while, I'd say do so with caution. Make sure you have all of your questions prepared, and take his answers as-is. Like I think someone else in this thread said: if it's for reconciliation, I'd probably be better to wait longer, because the same issues that led to the breakup will likely resurface.  Good luck! ||| Closure is the one last thing I’d advice people to get from people you think have hurt you. It will only spiral down you into rethinking about it and all your hard-work for the past 4 months will mean nothing. I suggest you just give yourself one instead of asking from them. It will only create more doubt on your part to give yourself one instead reasons to weep more. Be careful of what is it you want ||| Did you reflect on what happened? Because in my case, after going thru some messages, I figured it was actually my problem and the closure was self realisation rather than from her. ||| It's 4 months and there is a high chance he doesn't love you anymore and there is also a chance that he found someone else already. It's not worth it. ||| im guessing you’re blocked? why an email?"
Breakup help please :(,"This morning I had a really hard conversation with my boyfriend. We are truly best friends and act like little kids together - he is one of my absolute favorite people I have ever met. As a person, and as a person WITH me, I love him. I see all of the lovely positive things. We’ve been dating for a year and a half, and this morning, I had to call him to break things off. I am so heartbroken. Nothing explosive happened, I just got tired of waiting around for the maturity that I was begging for. He was the most loving caring boyfriend when it was just the two of us, but as soon as his friends came along, it was like I didn’t exist. He very much over prioritized his friends, which to an extent is healthy, but this was not. Him and his friends way of life is going out all night until 3am and getting as drunk as they can. I hate it. I feel like we are unfortunately soulmates on two completely different maturity levels. He never really talked about the future with me, wasn’t super introspective like I am, but he did sure as hell make me happy a lot of the time. I’ve never had a boyfriend as amazing as he was for me, but I don’t think the timing is right. We decided today to not speak for one week, but I’m already literally dying and I feel out of my mind sad. Any advice or thoughts? :( thank you",1,2,2025-06-29 12:43:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lndsj8/breakup_help_please/,,,"I’m so sorry, this is the worst feeling. Please know that as you heal that him prioritizing his friends over you is so incredibly shitty and mean. I had an ex cut vacations and visits short because he wanted to visit his friends, he wouldn’t take responsibility either and made me feel bad that I was preventing him from seeing his friends when he was the one cutting visits and phone calls early! There are plenty of people out there that get excited to see YOU and hang out with YOU and prioritize YOU! Just give yourself some time grieve. I’m proud of you for wanting better and acting on it. As a heads up, be prepared for this to scare him so bad that he may end up committing more to the next person he dates in a way he didn’t with you. It stings and it hurts but it’s a weird response men have when they finally get consequences for acting childish and don’t want to lose the next girl. It has nothing to do with you.

"Alone, out of the blue, and everything hurts.","I guess I just need some place to pour my heart out a little as my friends have already heard about everything a million times. My partner (26, nb/MtF) left me (26, f) all of a sudden after three years of being together. I mean, for me it was all of a sudden. We have been living together for most of our relationship. When I got home from work, they were standing in the door with some of their belongings in a backpack and told me that they know that this is going to break my heart, but they don't know how to else to do this and that they left me a letter on my desk and they need to leave. I was begging, crying, for just a chance to talk about it, but they just told me that if they don't leave now, they will not be able to leave. After that, everything was very vague: ""So you are breaking up with me?"" - ""I think so"". ""Do you think we can ever have another chance?"" - ""I don't know"". ""Do you still love me?"" - ""Yes"". ""Do you believe me that I am going to change?"" - ""I don't know, but I don't think so, because I don't think you can"". - And then they just left, leaving me standing there. In the letter, they briefly told me that they felt they were losing themself, that I was belittling them, they couldn't be my whole world anymore, that we needed to be apart to grow as individuals. Again, that they love me so much and respect me.

And I know all of that. I have a lot of trauma that I have been working through for years, also with a therapist, and have made a lot of progress, but apparently it was not enough. I struggle very badly with fear of abandonment, causing me to be clingy and jealous and also very mean sometimes. But it was always something I was willing to work on, I always said we should talk about it, they should communicate with me, call me out on my bs and look for solutions with me. But nothing happened; they brought it up very little, and if they did and I gave any backlash, the talk was immediately over. Also, I expected them to do way too much for me. But if they didn't, I might have seemed disappointed, but I would have never blamed them, was never violent, insulting, whatever. So yes, I did a lot of things wrong. And my fear of losing them made me keep them small. But I always loved them, always wanted us to grow and talk about it, and there was nothing I would not have done to make it work. I was so willing to fight for it. But instead of communicating, they just skipped all possible stages of escalation and just left.

Yes, they also had and have a lot of issues. With themself, with expressing feelings, with communication, with criticism, with just having started working full time and being very unhappy with it.  Drinking and eating to regulate feelings. But they kept on pushing me away, whenever I wanted to support them, talk it out, help them grow. And whenever I talked about plans for the future, they were avoiding anything that was not very distant and vague.

The night before they left, they were super lovey dovey. Wanting to snuggle at night, spending all evening consciously with me and goofing around with me. Just a few days ago, I had bought concert tickets for both of us without them making any hints at not being able to make it.

And now they are just gone. For the first 48 hours, I kept on sending desperate messages, begging them to come back and talk to me and give me another chance after I finally realized how bad I truly needed to leave my comfort zone and change. After that, I kind of gave up. I am slowly starting to pack up their things as much as possible, not flinch whenever I hear the elevator, keep up my routines, go to work and be as independent as they always wanted me to be. Two days ago, I asked them to please communicate with me when they plan on coming back to our apartment to get stuff or talk, so I am not in constant waiting mode, but nothing came back.

Tl;dr: I messes up really bad due to old wounds and not wanting to leave my comfort zone and they did not communicate how fed up they were getting with me and what was at risk and then just left our shared place and have been ignoring me since with their stuff all around me. I take full responsibility for everything except their inability to communicate, but it just hurts so much to have lost my best friend and my lover and what for the first time felt like family and home. And I keep on asking myself if any of it was ever true.",2,0,2025-06-29 08:57:40,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lna3zg/alone_out_of_the_blue_and_everything_hurts/,,,
My boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me out of nowhere and I’m still so confused,"I’ve never posted anything on Reddit, but I’m just so confused by what has transpired recently for me that I wanted to see if anyone had some advice or could relate to what I’m going through. 

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 1 1/2 years and our relationship has been nothing but amazing. We clicked instantly because of our similar interests, and there was a never a moment where we weren’t talking or making each other laugh. We also made it a point to see each other regularly and were heavily intertwined into each other’s families and friends. There was not a single inclination I had that we were breaking up anytime soon, and every interaction/behavior we had up to that point was completely normal. My last memory before we broke up was of him tucking me back into bed before he went to work, telling me he couldn’t wait to see me on Saturday (normal date day for us), and then coming back one more time before he left because he wanted one final kiss. Not what I would consider normal behavior for someone who was planning to break up with his girlfriend in 3 days. 

On Saturday, I received a text from him in the morning saying that he apologized for this coming out of left field but he wanted to meet earlier to talk about some things. In my heart, I knew it sounded like he was about to break up with me but I was still so confused why this was happening now all of sudden. I drove to the location and met him there and he asks to get into my car to talk. Right away, he breaks up with me. Even though the earlier text sorta clued me into what was possibly happening, I still sat there in shock because I couldn’t actually believe this was real. What made me even more confused was the reason. 

For prior context, we have a slight age gap. Me (24F) and him (27M). It’s never been a problem in the past because we got together out of college and when we were both in similar places in life (ie living in the same city and working jobs). We live in a city that both of us grew up in and while he loves it there I’ve always seen myself living somewhere else. This is in large part because I’ve always dreamt of going to medical school. I’ve been working a job now for 2 years as gap years before medical school because I wanted my application to be the best it could possibly be before I applied. He obviously knows about my dream to go to medical school and has been nothing but supportive about it. However, it’s been the elephant in the room when it comes to our relationship. We have never really talked about what life would look like if I were to actually get into med school. I also won’t be applying to medical school until at the earliest mid next year and going the year after. That being said, I know I stand the best chance of getting into medical schools in the state that he and I are both residents in, which does change things. 

He said the reason why he is breaking up with me is because he doesn’t see how his future and my future line up because of me wanting to go to medical school so he would rather break up now then possibly grow cold and distant or do something that would end up hurting me later. He wanted to let me know that I did nothing wrong and that’s what makes this harder, because our relationship had been nothing but happy. In my shock I really didn’t say much, but I did ask how long he was thinking about this and he said “not long, it’s been something that was gradual but I was really thinking about it the last 2 days”. I can’t help but feel like he woke up one morning and thought to himself “let me blow up my relationship” but he has never been that type of person before. 

I think what confuses me the most, and what I would love advice on, is the fact that he did all this talking about “our futures” but never once have we ever actually talked about our futures seeing as I am half of it. I’m not saying our relationship wasn’t still going to end after this talk, at this point I will never know, but to be cut out of this conversation completely and the decision made without even a word from me feels disrespectful. It’s like he just gave up on our relationship before it even got hard, that it wasn’t even worth fighting for. If he would have said to me that he feels like in his gut I’m not the one then okay, I can’t get mad at that or change that. But he didn’t. Just that my future with medical school doesn’t line up with him so he would rather end it now.

I guess I’m just a little confused and hurt by this sudden switch. He has been nothing but a great guy who I wish the absolute best to, but I have no idea why this came out of nowhere right at this moment.

They crunch the numbers in their head, weigh the pros and cons, and then make a final conclusion -- all without consulting their partner. It can seem like a very selfish process (and oftentimes it is), but from their perspective, there's no point in consulting their partner because ultimately it's \*their\* choice if they want to remain in the relationship or not.  Anyway, I'm very sorry that this happened to you. You didn't deserve it. ||| I would also feel like I wasnt getting the full picture. Your confusion is warranted!   That said, don’t chase him. Go work on that future. He’s either not being forthcoming with you OR he really is that daunted by your future that he’s running away.

He feels because of my age (i am 42 and he's 35) that I wont be able to have kids and that he feels pressured to move his timeline up. The first thing I asked him before we even got together was ""are you okay with my age and if I he was okay with the possibility of me not being able to have kids"" he said yes age was nothing but a number and he already has a kid so he was okay ass well. The first couple of days was killer. The complete silence. I drank myself to a stupor to numb the pain. I had to block him on social so I wouldnt see his face online. I deleted his number so I dont have the urge to reach out and left the door open in case he did. But now he is blocked. it's been over a week. If you keep analyzing everything it just causes more confusion and sadness. We will never get an answer. And we just have to accept that. Even though its hard. From hot to cold.

Working together post breakup,"I broke up with my ex a day and a half ago. It was a short but devastating breakup. We loved each other deeply and still do, but had to make the decision for an amicable breakup, because sometimes love isn't enough and you know there's an expiration date to the relationship.

We bickered about petty issues, no major fight ever took place but we got upset often, neither of us are toxic individuals by ourselves, we work together and right outside our workplace is where the relationship started and right there is where it ended. We talked a lot, we chatted, laughed, got emotional as well but we decided it was for the best.

The thing is I'm now in a spiral of blame and guilting myself, we still talk at work but we have decided to maintain distance until we are in a position to just be friends because both of us made a great and positive impact in each others lives and we want to be there, even if it is a platonic relationship. 

I'm still upset, we chat at work even post our breakup, but we talk about work stuff and other random things. We couldn't be together because of multiple external things that stressed us out a lot and often was misdirected towards each other.

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? How do you cope with this, I still see my ex partner and will keep seeing him at work and that's not maintaining distance. I've been looking for new jobs. But I don't know why there's still a shimmer of hope that maybe things will change, it's completely irrational I know. I've done the whole nine yards and know I just need to give myself time to get over this breakup and accept my ex as not just an ex partner but as an amazing friend. We even gave each other parting gifts. The thing is, even though we were both in the same place, even though we both knew it was coming and came to an amicable separation without any huss or fuss, I see him taking all the steps, since we still chat, my partner told me he deleted all of our photos, he didn't want a reminder of what could be. I didn't. I'm still holding onto some things. I want to take that step as well and move on but I've never been able to and I just sit in grief and give myself time, the distance does the rest. But here distance is not a factor and this troubles me more. Maybe switching jobs would work but it's not happening any time soon. 

There's so many things to come for us, and we decided we'd give each other major life updates and I'm totally in for that. There's important things that I do want to know about. But right now, it's more the feeling of him on the path to reaching a stable place, while I'm barely accepting the fact that we couldn't be together because of a few issues that had nothing to do with us as individuals. It's also the fact that she's got people to talk about this at our workplace. People he's really good with, his family lives by close as well and has a sibling. I don't have any of this and feel kind of alone in the moment. I had moved to this country not very long ago and that's also a factor that might be affecting me.

He came back,"He came back and he asked for another chance but this time I don’t want to. Trust me these past few days I was begging to God to rewind time to so I could be with him. But even though I love him dearly I’m still angry at him. I’m scared that I’ll take him for granted and yet again the same cycle will repeat. This breakup made me realize that I hardly have any self love and self respect and until I learn to respect myself and love myself, can I truly love another… plus I feel like I’m mental drained, I want to be the person I was 3 years ago willing to give him my life and more but I’m tired and exhausted. I don’t think despite all his mistakes he deserves my mentally deranged self. Despite all his flaws, he still deserves to be with someone who gives him unconditional attention. He’s looking for the person whom he met three years ago but the truth is, him and I both killed that person and she’s dead and gone. reading chats of separated couples (for work purposes) always gives me a glance of my future. If I pick a life with him I know our chats in the future will be far worse than those separated couples. Eventually what I realized is either way I’m bound to be sad with him or without him so I guess I have no choice to pick the latter but this is a choice I want to make, I don’t want him to look out for me and neither do I want him to understand any of this.

It’s me not you break up (LONG),"Sooo my bf of about 2 months broke up w me a couple days ago & I’m so torn up. He said that he doesn’t like himself right now (hes been wanting to lose weight.) and that he couldn’t give me the type of emotion that a relationship requires. Which he is basing of one incident that sort of was the cause of the argument before he ended things. One day he came over and his energy was just so off he didn’t seem like he wanted to be there or like he was happy to see me & I called him out on it. As he was breaking up w me he said he was happy he just doesn’t know why he can’t show it (which confuses me bc that’s the first time I got that bad energy from him) Another reason he was down was because of my outfit (per his words) he said he just expects more when we’re going out, which is cool everyone has preferences I didn’t think the outfit was bad for the movies but w/e. What bugged me was we hadn’t seen each other in a couple days prior to this and instead of being happy to be with me and make memories you’re worried about what I’m wearing??? Put me off fs. We ended up not talking for a whole day and I’m waiting to see if he put in any effort to try to talk to me or anything bc the argument generated basically from him. It came out later when we were breaking up that he was okay within those 24hrs not talking me. Mind you I was checking my phone nonstop waiting for a text or anything.

Back to the break up he continues to say that I deserve better because he can’t give me that type of emotion I deserve and he can’t give me everything and that he just wants to be alone. He thought he was ready for a relationship but he’s not. Ig all the emotions that goes into a relationship was possibly too much while dealing w his one personal mental issues.

Just a background on the relationship everything was so so sweet. We both were crushing on each other for monthsssssss before we even spoke a word to each other. We both never thought it would have gotten to a relationship bc how long we just oogled each other from afar. Honestly I didn’t have too many red flags blaring prior to that day. & honestly I was shocked to be getting dumped bc I didn’t feel the argument was that bad. But we were both crying ugly tears as it was happening and he said he’s not deleting any pictures only bc I said I couldn’t force myself to do it. & he still was calling me baby and all that and said if I need anything he’s always there. He kept apologizing as well and saying his decision has nothing to do w me.

I asked him when he’s doing better does he see a place for us together and he said he didn’t want to jinx it.

I wrote this to get some thoughts and opinions about this…me personally I don’t ever think the it’s me not you thing is real. & I understand I may never know if he was being genuine but I just feel better talking about it and getting thoughts and opinions and gathering others experiences. I really feel so heartbroken. It hurts even worse bc I’m not angry w him. But also because I feel like I was so in it and into him and he wasn’t. I told him I’ve dealt w mental health issues so I understand and wouldn’t mind being w him through it. (He just said he wants to be alone) Maybe he just lost feelings? Bc he said in the beginning he said he was finally happy after a long time. Maybe he’s self sabotaging?? I really have no clue and that makes it worse. I which he was straight up w me. Also he hasn’t deleted our pictures on Instagram yet. Anyways how’d you guys get over your first heartbreak? (I’m struggling here the day after I could NOT stop crying and I’ve been thinking abt him nonstop & it makes it 1000x worse bc we work together thankfully not on the same shift but I’m reminded of him everywhere. All the little corners we used to sneak to get a hug or kiss in. The places we caught each others eye for the first time just everything & it hurts so much.)",3,0,2025-06-29 06:08:07,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln7kqk/its_me_not_you_break_up_long/,,,
Break up story 😔,"Okay so I have been holding this in for a while! 

Basically I 18(m) was dating a girl (19f) since high school (I was like 16 she was 17 at the time) so we've had a series of arguements a lot which is probably why she cheated. So this one day I was going to my class in third period and I get a text from my friend saying she did something with his brother (did the deed with him) and I started to spiral out because I didn't take it well- so I stormed to her and kind of made a scene (I think I was over reacting on that one) and showed her what my friend told me and showed me, and she just started trying to hug me out of nowhere (mind you I was still mad as hell) and I'm trying to get myself to calm down and she's just been trying and trying to get the situation over with. And a few weeks later I asked her why she did it. Turns out she did it because he called her a chicken :/ (at that time I forgave her but I was also weak so I took her back, thinking I could change her, foolish young me move of course)

 Fast Forward 2 years later I went to her work place for a tour and information session, everything was normal and all that. Then a few weeks later I get a call from her checking in on me and she tells me ""I need you to tell (we'll call him Steve) Steve that we broke up, and I already gathered that she and him were dating. So I told her "" yeah because you and him are dating"" and she tells me ""yeah.. I'm sorry"" and she starts telling me ""I didn't want to hurt you during your birthday month"" (My birthday was June 19th btw!) And she proceeds to start trying to justify why she did it, she said she was lonely (mind you at the time I visited her work place I told her specifically I didn't have my phone so I couldn't actually text her for a while, and the day she called me I got my phone back) and she said I wasn't talking to her and how I wouldn't communicate, mind you I never had my phone at that time! So to end this off I honestly just said ""please don't bother trying to call me back"" I hung up and blocked her number

And since then I have been working on myself but one of my coworkers (I'll call her Asia) me and her started talking and well we got into a relationship and it's safe to say I believe she is the one for me, she's nice and understanding and she communicates like a Honor Roll student (basically she is top tier at communicating) and since then I've just enjoyed being with her a lot! So uh I hope you guys enjoyed this sorry it's long- I don't know if anybody is actually gonna read this 😭😭😭but if you do: Thank you ‼️‼️‼️‼️",1,0,2025-06-29 12:02:15,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lnd0w6/break_up_story/,,,
how can i move on?,"Me and my girlfriend went our seperate ways around christmas, i was okay for a month but after that it all went downhill. i cry most days thinking about all my mistakes and of what could have been, i taught it would get better but after half a year im even worse. yesterday i tried talking to her, to see if there is any chance for me, and she politely told me that she moved in and someone else makes her happy. of course im happy for her and id never do anything to ruin her fun. Ive come to terms that i lost my soulmate forever and i wanna know how can i start doing better. ive always had trouble expressing my emotions to people and its really hard now that i have noone to talk to. id be thankfull for any advice.",2,8,2025-06-29 08:09:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln9eul/how_can_i_move_on/,,,"Hello and thank you for sharing.  To give a bit of context, I’m 3 months into my breakup.  Me and my ex were together for near 7 years, since I was maybe 16-17 to now; I’m 23.   The first thing I’ll say is the pain you’re going through is so very real and so very debilitating. Some days you feel like you can take your life back into your own hands and be happy without them, and other days the waves of sadness and loss hits you like a truck.  And you cry and cry, and in your quiet moments you feel you can never be okay again.   Right now, a lot of advice may not make sense to you and you might not even want to hear it, so I’ll skip some of the “love yourself” advice (though it is very true)   My best piece of advice I can give you is also the hardest to do: let her go. Let her fully go right now.  The only way you are going to begin to heal is if you convince yourself that she’s never going to come back to you and she’s made the decision to remove you from her life, whether or not she initiated the breakup or you did. Don’t let her tell you over and over. Let her go.   Only then will things begin to get better. Everything else will follow, all the advice and cliche sayings will follow if you make this step to take your own life back.   You might ask “why will I only heal after letting her go?”  Because you’re trapping yourself in limbo, stunting the side of you that knows she’s not coming back and refusing to heal in hopes she will  You also have to MEAN it when you say it; to actually let her go and then FIGHT for your right to be happy again. You can do it my friend ||| Firstly to accept that she is truly gone and it's your path to take and start to let her go now. Delete your pictures and don't backread through your old conversation. Don't stalk her profile and if you have to urge to stalk her then it's time to take a break from the internet. Find something new to disturb your mind from thinking about her such as intense workouts like gyms. If your head is full of thoughts then I suggest journaling. Let your emotions out and let  your tears cry because suppressing is gonna make you explode like a balloon. Take your time whatever you need and enjoy your life with your own. ||| The Gym is the only way bro. Go no contact. Like seriously. It might be too much, but you need to take care of yourself first man! I know this is heartbreaking. Love can't be forced back to anyone and I don't think you have to care for them when all you have is YOU right now. Build, improve, and become the better version of yourself, fix all of your issues and you have to move on dude.      Dude, I feel ya. I just got dumped a week ago and all of this has been hitting me hard. If you wanna vent and talk it out, just know I'll be there for you. If you wish, please hit a DM!"
There is no avoidant or anxious attachment,"Its all bullshit to explain normal human behavior. To sell you hope. To preserve your ego. Because its too painful to admit you wasted time on person, who was not that much into you. Instead its easier to create bullshit theory about fear and pushing away. So called ""Avoidants""  just don't like you that much. Yeah, hurts. But that is the truth. They dont. Maybe its convenient to have you in their life for some reason. That's about it. This is the truth. Not all crap you read about love to try to explain their behavior. If they dont like someone that much they won't go extra mile. That's it. I didn't for my ex. But for the woman I loved I became hopeless romantic overnight. Why? Because i loved her. 
Same with anxious. They just like this person too much. That's it. Anxious people, remember how you behaved when you didn't like someone that much? Think about it. You were not so loving, not so caring. Acting just like....avoidant lol. 
Its all about level of attraction, not these stupid theories. ",0,16,2025-06-29 11:54:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lncvtv/there_is_no_avoidant_or_anxious_attachment/,,,"Nah there definitely is but it can be both. Nobody follows exact patterns of behaviour but features of it, these attachment styles are merely that - patterns. People can shift their behaviour and beliefs over time with the right effort, environment. The right partner can make an anxious person secure and the wrong person can make a secure person anxious. ||| It’s a real and very well studied topic in psychology. That being said, it was originally created to explain the attachment behaviors of children and is crudely applied to adults. Adult relationships are very complicated with finances, geography, age, health, etc. involved. The majority of the science community does not embrace attachment theory the way Reddit tries to use it. ||| Edgelord lol ||| Attachment theory is based upon decades of research. I would encourage those questioning attachment theory to look into this research. You may like to start by check out the following:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqlbvpXp74k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqlbvpXp74k)  Love Sense by Sue Johnson (book)  Secure Love by Julie Menanno (book)  Emotionally focused therapy (which is a highly effective couples therapy modality, for those who may at some point wish to pursue a couples therapy route), which is based upon attachment theory, also has over 30 years of research supporting its use.  The research speaks for itself. ||| I mean if you’re only looking into it because some random told you you can do this or that to get them back then sure, or if you’re paying for shit. Other than that I found it extremely helpful in understanding my own behavior patterns and that of the person I was in the longest and most profound relationship with.   Of course it’s all human behavior. And then it’s categorized into groups based off patterns. It’s helpful to people to see these patterns, identify with what’s behind them, understand what could be going on that makes us behave that way, and how it can be addressed based on what works for people within that category.   Personally, my avoidant ex loved me deeply. He liked me more than anyone in the world and still does. Recently learned he told a friend he’s going to love me for the rest of my life and wish every woman he was with had my personality and traits but he can’t hurt me ever again. I myself can be avoidant too and I’ll tell you my avoidant behavior in my most recent relationship was NOT avoidant it was  actually me not being very into him at all. I stayed too long. Had I been in love with him, totally attracted to him, and liked his personality a lot and still acted and behaved the way I did it would’ve been avoidance but I wasn’t any of those things I just wasn’t all that into the guy   Just my perspective and experience ||| I agree, although I do believe attachment disorders exist. They’re just not as prevalent as people seem to think they are.  Attachment disorders are present in people who trauma and PTSD (abandoned or abused kids).   Most people just don’t want to admit that their ex just didn’t like them all that much or fell out of love ||| Sounds like a dismissive avoidant… lmfao ||| Ok so you don’t believe there is a such thing as avoidant or anxious attachment but I can say that emotional capacity and EQ play into the equation. I definitely found my ex’s limit and I know because everything I brought up he already knew were issues but never wanted to grow. It wasn’t just me because he was previously in a long relationship that he was blindsided from and he loved her but also admitted to me that he’s always done x,y,z and he not going to change it so there’s nothing to talk about. The things I brought up are things you can’t build a lasting relationship on. He cared about me enough to reflect on his behaviour and how it impacted me (which made him doubt his feelings for me), he tried to understand our hard conversations even if he didn’t fully grasp what I saying. You don’t do those things unless you care. ||| U make a good point, both sides can be true. I definitely believe in attachment styles but i also believe true love trumps all that shyt💯 ||| many people, especially fresh out of a breakup will assume the dumper was avoidant when in reality they just weren't into them anymore. But no, the idea that this magically erases attachment theory is not even slightly true. People do not have to follow these attachments so much so as to be completely predictable, but there are often times obvious patterns people show of being certain styles of attachment. I'm very anxious attached, but there have been times when some girls probably thought i was avoidant because i really just didn't feel the same way about them. But that's because i either wasn't attached to them to begin with or i lost those feelings later on. But if i do have an attachment to someone, it expresses itself anxiously. I'm sorry though, that this pain and heartbreak has maybe given you this feeling of disillusionment. I hope you will get through this stronger and happier in the end"
Should I tell my ex I want him back?,"I (28F) have been out of my relationship with my my ex boyfriend (28M) of 5 years for almost 1.5 years now. We had a healthy, amazing relationship. A lot of genuine love and care for each other and grew through so many stages of life including moving in together, getting a dog together, he really felt like my best friend.

I feel a lot of guilt for the relationship ending and feel like it was mostly my fault. At the time, I was starting a company that became my main focus, became very time-consuming and I stopped prioritizing the relationship and wasn't as present causing a strain. There also became a big lack of intimacy, which is strange because I'm very physically attracted to him. I initiated the breakup and he was crushed. A week later, I told him I regretted it and asked to get back together, to which he responded that he thought it was better we stayed separately, that we needed to grow as individuals and if it's meant to be, we'll find our way back together and make it work.

Now it's been 1.5 years later. Sometimes I feel completely fine being single and on my own, but other times I miss him and our relationship greatly. I've done a lot of work on myself, the company is in a much more stable place now, and I'm ready to prioritize my dating life. I know I would really regret it if I didn't try to give our relationship another shot as we both have grown, and I know what's needed to be done differently. However, I'm not sure if he feels the same way at all. How should I / should I even approach this situation?

Who knows what will happen unless you try it. Approach him by saying how you feel and how you miss your relationships and recalling good memories would be fine too. ||| As you said: you will regret it if you don't try one last time so just do it and avoid living with that weight the rest of your life ||| Just out of curiosity. Have you two been NC this whole time?  Why not telling him what you just wrote here?

why does it hurt so bad why does your chest feel tight all the time? why can’t you breathe properly? why does food taste like nothing? why do you suddenly not want the comfort things that used to once help

and the worst part is how your mind just keeps pulling them into everything. no matter what you do, there they are. in your thoughts, in the background, in everything you try to escape into.

why is love sometimes so cruel? it feels so unfair. and yet we still sign up for it, knowing full well it could leave us like this, shattered, empty, hurting. i know there are people here who’ve been through this more than once including myself, and i don’t get how the heart still goes back to it every time. it’s such a strange thing 😭

I don't know exactly why we feel this way when we lose someone but it is definitely human nature.  It's important to try to remember not to beat yourself up.

But I know it's awful, believe me.  In time, you'll find that the feelings are easier to put aside, even if they haven't yet fully gone away, and you can go back to living your life and growing.

It make zero sense that he didn't fall in love with me. Zero.,"Together 6 months. Both of us had the same exact obscure hobbies (independently listed on our dating profiles before we even swiped on each other), same quirks, same life goals, everything down to the last detail. Emotionally mature, stable jobs, stable living situations, almost in our 30s. Knew what we were both looking for and expressed this explicitly: a life partner.

We spent those 6 months enjoying all of the obscure hobbies we shared. It was so much fun. It felt like he was falling so deeply in love with me, but we never got to those words. He initiated talk about moving in together next year, we met each other's families, took things very steady and mature. 5 weeks ago he calls and says he does not have the romantic capacity right now, is breaking up with me, doesn't want to try, and doesn't want to reconnect romantically in the future. I foolishly said that the next time we saw each other I was planning to tell him I loved him. He replied that he didn't get to that point with me. Huh????? How?????

And I know he is NOT an avoidant because he has been in many long-term relationships and stayed for years even when the other person has had overwhelming issues. I know he was doubting his career/job/family issues and they were getting to him but I cannot help but feel that this was either used as a lie or that he never cared at all because I cannot wrap my head around the fact that he didn't get anywhere near loving me. And I know that sounds shallow, but if you knew the interests we shared and the things he said/did, you'd be as fucking stunned as I am right now.

I am the shortest relationship he has ever had where he has been the one to break up. Either he lied to me about his reasoning, or he used me as a distraction, or he is really being truthful. But it's hard to see the fucking truth in anything right now. I feel like I lost my chance. It feels like the loss of my life. I've been through breakups before but I have NEVER begged the way I did with him because I thought that was it.

The Stranger God Sent to Save My Soul,"You know… sometimes, out of nowhere, God sends someone into your life—not to change it completely, but just to remind you that you’re not alone. That your pain is seen, your silence is heard, and your wounds are not invisible.

It’s like a small, divine mercy… a gentle touch sent straight from above.
Not to heal everything… but to ease the weight. To whisper, “I see you.”

Maybe they’re a stranger. Maybe they live thousands of miles away. Maybe you’ve never even met them in person.
But somehow… their words feel like home.
Their voice feels like something you’ve known forever.
And when you speak to them… you don’t have to explain every scar.
They just know.

Because they’ve been there.
They’ve cried the same way.
They’ve felt that silent kind of pain that sits on your chest at 3 AM.
And suddenly, you find yourself opening up without fear…
as if you’ve known them for decades, maybe lifetimes.

That’s not random. That’s not coincidence.
That’s mercy. That’s God showing you:
“You’re still human. You’re still worthy of connection. You still have a heart that can feel and be felt.”

After everything you’ve been through,
in this world that feels more broken by the day,
where being “normal” feels like a luxury,
where kindness feels rare and connection feels impossible…

That one soul—
That unexpected person—
makes you realize you’re still here.
Still capable of feeling.
Still capable of healing.

And maybe, just maybe…
you’re not as lost as you thought you were.",8,6,2025-06-28 23:14:59,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln055v/the_stranger_god_sent_to_save_my_soul/,,,"I installed Reddit after my breakup about 7 weeks ago. At first, it made things so much harder for me. Now, so many posts and responses are so nice, beautiful, and touching that I'm glad I kept Reddit. While I hate knowing that someone else is hurting like I was, like I still am to a lesser degree, it's also somewhat comforting knowing that my situation is not unique and I'm not alone in it. I don't feel pain anymore when I read a beautiful poem or a post about exes. I feel a detachment that allows me to appreciate it and understand it, without having to feel it deeply in a way that relates to my breakup.

Finally Deleting Photos Of Her,"This has been LONG overdue for me, but I’m finally getting around to deleting the photos I have of my ex, despite being broken up since late April. It just had to be done, I’m sick of seeing photos of her on my photos app & feeling sad & miserable. Although I’m not technically deleting them, I’m transferring them from my phone to my pc & deleting the photos on my phone, cuz even though I’m getting rid of them on my phone, I’m not 100% ready to completely delete them. Tbh I might just buy a external hard drive & transfer the photos to there & then just hide it somewhere, idk if that’s helping 100% but I think it fits with the whole outta sight outta mind idea. What was crazy is not only was I sad just revisiting the memories these photos had, I got insanely nauseous looking at them too, it was very weird. I’ve never really felt that way from a breakup before. I guess there’s a first for everything, but I’m glad I’m doing this, I needed to get the pics off of my phone but I’ll still cherish the memories we had",2,2,2025-06-29 06:41:47,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln83jf/finally_deleting_photos_of_her/,,,I still have my photos of us. But I hide it in my folder because I'm too scared of deleting it and seeing the picture again. Soon when I fully recover from breakup I will delete all of them so I can move on fully.
Why does it hurt so much when you’re the one who walked away?,"I was in a relationship that meant a lot to me. It was my first real experience of love, and we were each other’s “firsts” in many ways. In the beginning, everything felt right. He made an effort—surprised me with little things, checked in often, planned dates, made me feel secure. It felt like we were genuinely building something special.

But as time passed, I noticed a shift. He started pulling away—slow replies, less effort, fewer conversations. It felt like I was watching someone slowly stop choosing me. I kept asking him if we were okay, and every time, he’d say yes. And I believed him—because I wanted to believe him. Because I loved him enough to think maybe he was just in a rough place. But love shouldn’t feel like begging for attention. And that’s what it became.

He kept saying he’d change. He didn’t.

I reached a point where I had nothing left to hold onto, and even less to hope for. So I walked away—not because I stopped loving him, but because I finally realized he had stopped loving me a long time ago.

And now? Now I’m the one left hurting. I’m the one replaying everything in my head. I was the one who let go, but it still feels like I’m the one who got left behind.

It’s a different kind of pain when you have to mourn someone who’s still alive—but no longer who they used to be with you.

There is pain, asking yourself why he acted that way, and probably more than your fair share of self doubt. When I left my second ex wife, I spent a great deal of time asking myself if I had done everything I could have done to save the marriage.   Sometimes we have to make the tough choices. Once that happens, we ask ourselves why it still hurts. You can love him with every fiber of your being. The sad reality is that he can take your love and drag it through the mud. We have to accept that we deserve better. It may take some time and patience. But no matter how much it hurts to leave, it will always hurt more to stay ||| When you walk away it’s a last resort, your final response to something you hope might change. Sometimes it’s enough to wake a partner up and fix things. Sometimes it’s not. As you walk away you’re looking over your shoulder hoping they are chasing after you wanting to fix things. The pain comes from them not doing anything, just watching you walk away. That’s why it hurts being the dumper.   You did nothing wrong, you’re protecting yourself. You will meet someone else soon and that will help you heal. Make sure you go 100% no contact to help you heal faster. ||| he walked away not you, he prepared the base and you took the action, he wanted you to do this and not want to take the blame that he did this, maybe he got feelings for someone else?

It’s incredibly painful to watch love fade while you’re still holding on, still showing up, still hoping they’ll turn back toward you. And even when you choose to walk away, it doesn’t always feel empowering — sometimes it just feels like survival.  I went through something really similar, and I remember feeling like I was grieving someone who was still out there laughing, living, but not reaching back. What helped me was The Real Love Manual. It’s something I found when I was deep in that space — questioning everything and trying to make sense of how love could start so beautifully and end with so much silence. There’s a chapter in there about emotional unavailability, and how we confuse “potential” with presence. It helped me stop rewriting the past and start rewriting how I show up for myself.  You’re not alone in this. And even though it hurts now, the fact that you walked away is proof of your strength — not your failure. ||| Exact same situation here..it sucks. A good quote I read the other day  ""Sacrifice is the price to pay for ambition."" ||| I agree, that was my one huge question through my journey. How to grieve the living?! ||| If he is anything like me (we sound really similar) then he is destroyed. I sure am."
Post-relationship realization,"I think the saddest part about losing him was that he truly was the only person that understood me. He fully understood the loneliness I had felt for so long without me even having to explain it cuz he felt it too. He was always there for me and there was no doubt in my heart that he would’ve and would still do absolutely anything to protect me. 

We broke up for reasons that I wish never fucking happened. I wish he was kinder and didn’t say the things he said at the very end and I wish he realized that he was hurting me. I don’t regret breaking up with him but the loss of his presence has shown me that I have no one else but him. No one else that loves everything about me and makes me feel comfortable as I am without having to change myself to fit in with them. 

I can’t confide in my parents because are relationship was a secret (I’m brown) and my friends have shown me that they don’t care. I should be able to speak about my problems without someone who is supposed to be my best friend without her visibly acting irritated and disinterested. The thing is though, I wouldn’t even bother her with it consistently, maybe once or twice a couple months. I couldn’t even speak about when we were happy and having fun together with her because she would shut down. 

The problems within our relationship (which actually lead to the breakup) started in January but her behavior towards us has been for 2.5 years now. Idk I guess I didn’t realize how much it bothered me until I stopped opening up about how I felt with anyone but my boyfriend. And I didn’t realize that she didn’t really care until today. 

I know I’m not a good person and that I’ve made some deep mistakes towards her but I am proud of myself for at least having empathy. Of being able to put my own biases out of the way to be there for her no matter what. I just wish that the other people in my life did that for me too.

My feelings matter. And the only person who truly cared about me and how I felt is the one person I can’t talk to. 

What hurts the most is that we can never be friends and he truly was the most bestest friend I’ve ever had in my life. I love my fella. ",2,0,2025-06-29 06:12:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln7n2z/postrelationship_realization/,,,
"Boyfriend of 2.5 years blocked me suddenly, please help me move on","TL;DR: Boyfriend blocked me, I'm unable to control my emotions or actions.

My (29F) on-and-off boyfriend (31M) of 2.5 years blocked me today. We had a huge fight 2 weeks back - very public, very ugly. But we promised each other we would make it work.

Every day over the last 2 weeks he would reassure me that he loves me and he wants to make it work. We decided to see a marriage counsellor and sort all our problems and move forward.

Yesterday morning I said something he did not like - something along the lines of ""I didnt do anything wrong, you're making a big deal out of it"". And he blocked me, despite all the promises of making it work, promises that he would love me forever. I am struggling to keep myself from emailing him. I have already emailed him multiple times, but he has completely ignored them. How do I stop myself? What am I supposed to do, just start moving on? Without any closure, without anything - from promises of making it work to simply no contact?

Does he do things that make you lose control?  Consider time spent maturing, growing in perspective and emotional equilibrium. Like, you find your rhythm again. And you change your outlook, maybe requiring a more mature partner.  You should block him and not seek him out. That would be the first step. ||| What is the reason for this fight?

There are people out there that will sit and work through problems. I hope you and I find some of those people.     Short term i know this changes NOTHING about how you are feeling. I did the same thing. I spiraled, I emailed. I talked to a friend who said she venmoed 10 cents to her ex to get him to unblock her.   It sucks it's brutal it hurts. It feels like your whole world is ending and you can't even see past that particular moment.   Schedule your days as much as you can handle. I've been a workaholic for a while and have a main job +2 side jobs for extra income. I've been picking up more at the side jobs. All of these places are gyms so I take a walk on the treadmill go for a bike ride. Do SOMETHING. Even just sit and cry in the steam room.   I have a 2 year old niece as well and work with kids full time. Something about working with kids or being around them for me makes me distracted. And i teach in a pool and manage that same pool. I can book myself for up to 4 hours of swim lessons and I'm forced to not look at my phone.    Even with all of this^ I still cry- i still break down. Eating has been really hard. Sleeping has been really hard.   Just have to keep on going. ||| He’s upset because you said you’re not wrong and didn’t do anything wrong. Apparently you did something to set him off before that? At least something he didn’t like. But were you trying to understand his perspective? If you really didn’t do anything wrong then ok but if there’s something bothering him that he is bringing up and you’re not hearing him out then he’s probably shut down. I don’t know the situation but just something to consider. But you’re blocked so he doesn’t want to hear from you. So you need to wait for him to message you now. You guys are going to have to hear each other out on things and take responsibility if needed. Just because someone has a different perspective does not necessarily mean they are right or wrong. But if a relationship is going to work both people have to try to understand where the other is coming from. Easier said than done for sure. If he does unblock you and is willing to talk you should also go over not blocking each other. Just give it a little time. Good luck to you."
It Doesn't Hurt Anymore,"There was a time when thinking about him tore me apart. Every memory felt like an open wound. But today, it doesn’t hurt anymore. Not because I forgot, but because I learned to remember without pain. I healed at my own pace—slowly, but steadily. I looked at myself with honesty, embraced my mistakes, and understood that it’s not about holding on, but about learning to let go.

It was hard, because I loved deeply. But I also realized that self-love is the one that should never be missing. I no longer wait for him to come back, or to understand what I felt. I don’t need that. I loved him, yes. But today, I love myself more.

To those who feel like their world is falling apart, I say this: it’s not the end. It’s the beginning of something deeper—yourself. Solitude isn’t punishment; it’s sacred space to rebuild. True love begins within. And from there, everything changes.

She did me so wrong but I still miss her,"My ex 28(F) broke up with me 27(M) we were together for about 3 months but split about a month  and a half ago because she felt like she couldn’t love me the same as I had because her two jobs were kicking her ass she said she felt like it was unfair to me and wanted to set me free, it didn’t seem right to me because we were going strong so I asked if there was another person she was thinking or talking to, in tears she confirmed it to be a previous ex I asked why did she think that it was okay to start another relationship if you weren’t truly over this person? She couldn’t really answer I felt as though in her head she thought in her mind that she was ready but in her heart she wasn’t.

   it felt dehumanizing to be basically told that what you were doing wasn’t enough and were being replaced so easily, In our last meet she would tell me all these other reasons why we should split like we have too many differences(we really don’t) that we were incompatible(she never gave me examples) and there were things that affected our intimacy(again no examples) I of course know this is a full lack of communication on her part, then apparently there’s a list of things she didn’t like about me but when I asked what they were she never said it lol it’s all bs at this point I basically told her if you miss your ex just that and not come up with bs I was told the whole “your a great guy” thing in our initial conversation I wanted to suggest just taking a temporary break but I never got that chance.

Even after all she’s all I can think about I haven’t spoken to her since our last meet up part of me misses her like crazy but part of me can’t stand her for the lies, our time together wasn’t long but she was very special to me I would drive about an hour to her place some days just to sit around and do nothing just being there with her was enough for me, she’s been in my mind 24/7 and I don’t know if I’ll ever get over her I wish this didn’t happen I wish we were still together this is hard and this sucks I miss her so much even after all she’s done.

Potential breakup,"I (21F) am in a relationship with my boyfriend (22M) since November 2024. I met him When I was in a toxic relationship (5yrs) with my ex (23M) who cheated so much that I felt nothing towards the last 6 months (I found his s** tape). So when my current partner met me, he promised to give me better and I believed him and at first I did not get into the relationship for the right reasons, but I ended up loving him so much within just a few days. For context he never dated before, I’m his first girlfriend and he made the first move and when I started to feel a lot for him within like three days, he got rude and he would always say things that would hurt and I was like where was this when you were pursuing me? Maybe I gave in too easy…but I promise he gave me and said I deserve better. Cut to now, I look back and remember countless times when he made me feel like I’m so difficult and try to break up multiple times and I held us together and sometimes I just feel like everything was so forced… and for nearly 2 years I make the first move for everything. And there’s really no safety net. Well last night he tried to break up again because we met after a long time and I was very anxious. He said he does not have the wavelength to cater to my emotions and he referred to himself as a reductionist and he says I deserve better and that broke me because I did not expect it and for the past one month I have had severe depression. I cry myself to sleep and I wake up crying because I found out that he is watching porn. We are sexually active in the relationship. So that hurt and he promised to never go there again and he did say that it was a one time thing and I think I have proof for that so I believe it. But I have been trying to get over this but it is taking so long and the solution has been put on hold for the longest time because he had his assignments and his exams and so it took a whole month and finally it’s his holiday it’s been like four days and God knows how much I waited for his holidays only for him to say let’s break up because I am clearly unhealed from the pain he caused. When we meet things areL because I’m so anxious. I will keep asking for reassurance and it can get exhausting but then I feel like after so long he should know how to meet me in the middle and not use being a reductionist as an l excuse to not grow. However, yesterday morning before the whole wake up thing which happened at night it is important to note that I cried the previous night and he knew about it and so he promised that he will come and see me once his parents travel a lot more and that gave me so much hope, that was the happiest I’ve ever been in the safest I’ve ever felt and Then that midnight is when he initiated the break up after we had an argument… so I literally told him that I have waited for a whole month in the same state just for these holidays of yours to come and four days and you break up with me so it’s like my perseverance was for nothing. I asked him to give us one chance at least because we have been good but then he’s so pessimistic. He’s like no even when we’re good there’s problems and I had to tell him and convince him that every relationship can have problems, it’s how you bounce back from them that matters and I feel like I’m selling the idea of why he should give it a chance to him and that is so demeaning and right now I’m constantly calling him and he just talks like he has no interest and he acts like everything is fine now because he accepted giving it another try but I just feel like I’m a beggar in this relationship because when I stepped into this relationship, I did not expect this power dynamic. I really thought that he wanted me first and that is what it will always be like but then within a few days of starting the relationship the power dynamic completely switched as if I got scammed after I gave up everything to be with him. I want to leave, but I have an immense and intense fear of abandonment. It affects my health and I genuinely have no time in my life at the moment to go through a break up so I wanted to detach and leave because I give a lot of love and he admitted to that he said I’m very loving and he can’t match my love, which I honestly think it’s just weaponise and competence so please could you all give me suggestions And for context I have hobbies that I want to practice so I can get over this but nothing helps when it comes to my heart.

tl;dr: don’t know how tl;dr works but I’m Assuming it’s a summary? Basically, my boyfriend wants to end the relationship because he says I deserve better but I have invested so much and I’m not ready and so it hit me like a shock and I have still held this together and he tried multiple times to break up through the relationship and he just can’t handle any relationship stress almost as if you got into this relationship because he found me attractive not because he actually wanted a proper relationship with depth.",1,1,2025-06-29 08:39:35,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln9ui5/potential_breakup/,,,You deserve way better.

Wondering if buying his emergency break up kit is actually worth it? ,2,3,2025-06-29 04:38:16,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln64lx/coach_leeemergency_break_up_kit/,,,"I bought it, too bad I cannot download them and share, his website doesn't have that option, but it doesn't worth buying it, he doesn't say anything different than what he says on his youtube channel same videos.

Trying to Break up,"I'm (36f) trying to break up with my boyfriend (43m) of over a year.  For the last couple months, he has taken no initiative in the relationship.  If I want to see him, I have to plan it.  If I don't reach out, I dont see him.  I've also had a couple rough things happen over the last couple months (i.e. plumbing disaster, hotel with bed bugs) and each time he tells ""you are handling this so well!"" after I've told him I struggling to get through the day.  I told him it makes me feel worse because he's not letting me have a bad day. He says he understands/will do better and then does it again.  This has been going on for a couple months now.  I took some time to really journal and realized that I needed to break up with him.

However, in the last two weeks, he switched medication and has been going through a major depressive episode.  He's regularly talking to a therapist, working on his mental health, doing the work to feel better

I want to break up with him because the way he's been treating me is really getting to me, but I also don't want to kick him when he's struggling.  I'm trying to decide if its right to break up with him.  I dont love him anymore.  I know it's right for me, but I worry about him.  He's a nice guy--he's not listening to me/supporting me how I need but he's not a bad person.  

Can I break up with him now?  Do I need to wait for him to get himself together?  How do I do this?",2,3,2025-06-29 04:37:36,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln6475/trying_to_break_up/,,,I don't understand why you would be upset when your boyfriend compliments your ability to handle an emergency. ||| Break up with him now while he's talking to a therapist.

you don't get to say that it's hard to forget me when you blindsided me and replaced me with your coworker as if I never even existed. 

you don't get to paint yourself as 'hurting too' from a breakup you chose, unilaterally, painting me as the only problem, smearing my name and calling me toxic to people.

you don't get to say you miss me after I offered a second chance to fix it but you refused it and asked for space.

you don't get to say that it's hard when you've been in someone else's arms for months. 

you don't get my forgiveness after you didn't even manage to apologise properly.

I've given you unconditional love, affection, attention, care, support for a year. You threw me away like I was yesterday's trash when I needed you most and now you want my attention? My understanding? To relieve you of guilt? 

I wiped your tears while you were breaking my heart but you had the guts of painting me as the villain. 

I supported you and helped you on your thesis work for a year and celebrated your graduation with pride when you made it. And when it was my turn, I was left to do it all alone with a broken heart. And you couldn't even write a message saying congrats. You happily showed up to your coworker's graduation three weeks after dumping me though, even brought her flowers. 

And oh yeah, I even wished you happy birthday 5 days after graduating alone. Cause I'm really just that evil.

Some people seriously don't deserve anything.

Grieving all the experiences we didn't get to have,"My boyfriend [26M] and I [26F] broke up today. I initiated the break up because I felt like his heart had grown cold towards me, there was no more warmth from him. He had told me I was making him miserable multiple times. I had become desperate trying to win his affection back, doing everything I could to make him like me again and it was breaking my heart, so I ended things. 
This is the first relationship I ended while still being in love. 

A week before, I had moved to a new city to be closer to him. I really thought I'd marry this man. I had this fantasy of what our life would be like with me closer. I even started creating a new gaming setup, because I thought he could play games there while I did my own thing. I just wanted to be near him more. 
My first night there, we had gotten into an argument. I was laying in an empty room, alone, surrounded by boxes crying my heart out & he started referencing my ""next boyfriend"". I should have known then lol.
There were so many things I was excited to do with him. We never traveled together, swam together, I never saw his hometown. 
I feel so incredibly naive for being so invested in a man that wouldn't even publicized our relationship. A part of me regrets my choice, but the other part knows I would have driven myself crazy for staying in a relationship with someone who wasn't happy with me.

It's insanely difficultly right now, but I know that in a few months I'll know that this was for the best.   Take your time, allow yourself to grieve, but remember that all your feelings that led you here are 100% valid. Happy for you to DM me if you need any support. I personally moved across the world with my partner so definitely feeling a little lost and unsure at the moment.   Stay true to yourself! ||| >My first night there, we had gotten into an argument. I was laying in an empty room, alone, surrounded by boxes crying my heart out & he started referencing my ""next boyfriend"". I should have known then lol.  No, you should have known the first time that he said that you made his life miserable. ||| I feel you. The hardest and longest part of my heartbreak is all the things we said we'd do, but never got the chance to. I believe it might be because we fantazised about it in our heads and have all those expectations that reality never truly lives up to, so they just stay stuck in their idealized versions in our heads. I've been making my own memories and doing things I wanted to do with him on my own or with other people, even kicking and crying and punching in the air in frustration of my powerlessness sometimes lol, and this helped me get over some things and map the triggers of certain places and things I shouldn't be doing for a while. It sucks but it is what it is. My friends and family tell me that it would have been even harder if I had gotten to live those experiences because that would be more memories to get over, but I don't have a hard time blocking memories of the past - it's the ""memories of the unlived future"" that drives me crazy. The whole rather have regrets than remorse thing. But again - it is what it is, we just have to suck it up and do our best. ||| Please find a boyfriend that spends time with you when he comes over. Gaming addiction can be brutal on relationships. A guy who is really interested in you will want to do all the activities with you, not waste his time in your presence behind a screen.

Don’t waste yours waiting for a true connection."
Finally made up my mind,"Me (23M) and my girlfriend (23F) have been together for 2 years, we met at university and have been long distance for the past year, we live about 4 hours from each other. 

For the past year the plan has always been for her to move up to where I live. She has been fairly vocal about being very worried about it, as I live in a big city and she’s grown up in a small town. I began having doubts in the past few months about our compatibility and life goals. I’m very career driven and want to do really well. As opposed to her who has been working in her home town, but despite for a year having the knowledge of moving to me, has not applied for a single job in the area. She hasn’t even looked. 

She was meant to be moving in with me next weekend, however, this has been postponed due to the death of her grandfather, earlier this week, whom she was very close with and lived with. Originally I wanted to see how it would go with us living together in the hope maybe things changed and we became more compatible and she would start applying for jobs and enjoy living here. 

After the tragedy her family has been through I can no longer in good conscience have her move up here. It would be so much more awful and upsetting if I let her move out of fear of breaking up with her now, to then break up with her in 3 months when she’s moved half way across the country.

I’ve made up my mind, I need to breakup with her soon. But I just feel like the most awful person. Why couldn’t I have decided this 2 months ago before her grandad died? When she wasn’t already in pain. She’s talking about still moving here in a few weeks, so I need to break up with her soon. I think once the funerals and everything are out the way I’ll have to do it. 

I deeply care about her and love her, but I know we just aren’t right for each other. We just want different things. 

I don’t think she sees this coming at all. I’m praying part of her feels the same way. But I think she’s going to be completely blindsided by this, and it’s going to make an already down and grieving girl so much more hurt. But I feel like I don’t have a choice, I either do it now while the death of her grandfather is still fresh. Or I let her move here, let more time settle then break up with her and make her move back home, which I know will be worse.

I just feel so awful, but I know what I have to do.

 ",1,0,2025-06-29 08:17:06,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln9ipu/finally_made_up_my_mind/,,2 year(s),
Tell me not to,"break no contact. I’m about to send her something like “Hi, I hope things are well with you. I have had a lot of time to reflect on our friendship/relationship and I have gotten to a place where I feel like I can express myself more clearly and I have a stronger understanding of things I could’ve handled better on my end. If you are open to it, I’d love to have a phone call some time and catch up.”

So yeah. I always get mixed advice on whether to reach out or not. In my mind I think it makes sense not to, but my emotions are well…. Craving her like hell.

Some of the things I think about to try and rationalize doing this are like the way I ended it, the way I initiated no contact coldly without explanation. How I contradicted myself when we broke up in saying I can’t be friends with her. Hell there are times where I accept there is no more hope romantically just abandon my self respect for one more guilt ridden nut.




Writing this out helped. Thank you for reading. Advice welcome.

Edit: I think it might be important to include how the breakup happened. We met in recovery, were friends for over a year, started dating (her initiating it, I just couldn’t say no) the day after I had a slip. A month into the relationship I told her I had kept it, and she decided to break up with me saying that I wasnt ready for her (specifically her, it hurt) and that she couldn’t trust anything I ever said anymore. She said she could maybe be friends in a few months to a year, and then I said I don’t want to ever be friends (contradicting a desperate text I sent earlier saying I want to be a part of her life in any way at whatever pace she is comfortable with).

There is a music festival coming up at the end of July we are both volunteering at which we planned before the breakup. I want to go with her but this whole thing is wrecking my brain.",12,42,2025-06-28 19:13:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmuus7/tell_me_not_to/,,,"Reach out if you want, but be prepared to end up feeling even worse than you feel now. ||| Don’t reach out, you’re already hurt.

Not to give you hope but after a month mine reached out to me. Talked a couple days. She disappeared. Been 3 weeks and now she’s lurking my socials and we’re not even friends. I’ve grown so much since she left and she probably realizes what she lost. Screw her. And for you just keep focusing on yourself. If she wants to talk let her come to you. Keep your power.

Almost right before I hit that send button I get that deep regretful powerless feeling in my stomach. That's what you're doing.

If she wanted to bridge that gap and make her way back to you it would have happened already. ||| I don't know how old you or she is, but I assume younger.  I'm older and have had a lot of experience and time to reflect on relationships as well as have two boys who have struggled with relationships.  What I see generally is that women can and do move on fast to another relationship, it seems easier for them.  I wouldn't be surprised if she's already with the next prospect of what she wants.  The boys get their hearts broken.  There doesn't seem to be what I call much ""glue"" to hold relationships together these days, such as real commitment or already a child or something like that.  So, like on the dating sites it's easy to just swipe for the next one, especially for women.  Most don't try to work anything out because they think they can find what they want easily without any sacrifice on their part.  Both my boys are still single in their thirties and I don't know if they will ever have a family.  Even if they do, the divorce rate is so high these days and guys usually get screwed financially.  I'm not meaning to be discouraging, but only realistic.  I don't have any answers really even to help my boys.  I'm just stating what I observe.  A lot of the American young women are in therapy, on anti-depressants and anxiety medicine.  Many are trying to climb the corporate ladder at the sacrifice of what matters the most in life in the end which is a caring partner and a family.  I'm not sure what's going to happen 20 or 30 years from now.  Maybe they will see what was missed and try to find that later.  In response to your question, do what you feel you have to do, reaching out is not a bad thing.  But be prepared that she has already moved on and in that case maybe you dodged a ""bullet"" and longer suffering. ||| Such a hard question to answer. Every person and relationship is so very different. The recovery part? That’s a little more of a slippery slope though, if it could endanger either of you then stay no contact but she may need a friend at times and knowing you are sorry for taking that away may help you both. This is your journey, only each our own selves can make our life decisions. Good luck to you and congratulations to you for your recovery. ||| I think you should do what feels right. Like most of the commenters said, just be prepared for the worst outcome. ||| If you don’t reach out, you will never know. Uncertainty can be painful, but it seems to work well for a lot of people.   If you reach out, you could either get an excellent response, a disappointing one, or no response.   Are you prepared to deal with the latter?  If so, go ahead. If not, stay silent.  If they want you in their life they will find you."

I cried the first two or three days and have been feeling normal ever since. I feel like I should be a lot more devastated.   It’s a bit different because you were the one who initiated the break up. If you’ve been considering breaking up for a while, you probably slowly started to emotionally disconnect yourself until you were ready to end things. We tend to prepare ourselves for emotional things like this, it’s like when a loved one is very elderly or terminally ill, you know they’ll be gone soon and prepare for the grief. When the loved one passes you still feel sad that they’re gone but also a sense of peace that it’s over. As opposed to a sudden and unexpected death of a loved one.  Of course breakups are not on the same level as experiencing a death, but you prepared and anticipated the breakup, for your ex it was sudden and unexpected (I assume)."
Jesus christ...,"Got dumped. Thought we were done. When she said I didnt meet her standards and she needed space, I accepted it and thought we were legit done. Talked a little the next day confirming it and ended with wishing each other well and thought that was the last time talking. Next few days she randomly asks me how im doing and seemed high interest and initiating contact. Fast responses, and long messages. After going back and forth a while I ended the conversation respectfully. This was like 3 days after breaking up. After watching some YouTube I realize this was when I should have set a date when she was initiating lol. Another week went by and today when I texted her it was long response times and low interest replies, she definitely took the other day as a rejection and may have lost any remaining attraction smh. 

I guess at this point its no contact for real but pretty sure I completely lost her not setting the date the other day...

Am I getting manipulated,She started liking posts I’ve reposted all of a sudden after we broke up a couple weeks ago because she felt like “she couldn’t think of anything to talk about”. She’s also reposted videos about missing me. When I reposted about missing her she liked it and then started reposting videos about how “I’m not her person”. Any thoughts,1,5,2025-06-29 06:57:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln8c2d/am_i_getting_manipulated/,,,You guys broke up because she couldn't think of anything to talk about?

The last Christmas card from my ex girlfriend,"To be clear, she is alive! My ex girlfriend and I had been together four about 2 and a half years and around March of 2024 we broke up. We both really loved each but factors including we were still young and immature in some ways, and anxiety in particular is something I struggled with immensely. Throughout our relationship until recently I felt as though she loved me but disliked the anxiety aspects of myself. I was randomly looking in my closet and I saw a Christmas card she gave be from Christmas the previous year, but due to the hurt I was experiencing at the moment I never opened it and forgot about it until now. The note basically said despite the pain she was going through she loved me more than anything, and I was incredibly kind and loving and that the fact that I struggle so much with my anxiety and just ""self worth"" in general. I read the card a few days ago and since then I have been reexamining my past and my relations|ship with her. As I looked back I came to realize that my anxiety and general low self esteem had shaped how I viewed aspects of my past, especially her. Were not in a relationship any more, but for a time in my life I had someone who accepted me and loved me but I was never able to see it fully, but for the first time in my life I feel as though I am not my anxiety and am capable of having genuine connections with others.",1,0,2025-06-29 06:55:00,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln8alc/the_last_christmas_card_from_my_ex_girlfriend/,,,
advice,"Hey, i broke up with my ex back in october, and i just wanted to give everyone some advice who just got out of a relationship and is feeling heartbroken.

It gets easier. i know it’s something you’re sick of hearing and something you just can’t ever imagine but believe it or not it does get easier. and i wont lie to you and say that you’ll completely forget that person, no you’ll always remember them. But by time you’ll just learn to live with those memories and be unaffected by it. So please whatever it is whatever you’re doing understand that you can’t rush into anything and just give urself time to grieve, be angry or whatever you feel like doing but by time you will feel better 

They always regret it. if you broke up with your partner because they did you wrong whether it’s cheating or just disrespect, they always regret it. It might not happen instantly, but it sure happens sooner than you think. and when it does happen you’ll finally be at peace with yourself knowing that yes it might be a small step but it’s a good step to actually help you move on 

My last and final thing i want to say what alot of you might not agree on, is to forgive. Yes you might even get pissed off or angry about the thought of forgiving someone that did you wrong. But trust me it feels better. forgiving doesn’t mean forgetting what happened and just going back to normal. No forgiving means to just come to peace with everything. yes they cheated, yes they disrespected, yes they broke your heart. you’ve finally learnt to accept that and move on from your life. Forgiving doesn’t happen quick you don’t have to forgive now or tomorrow or anytime sooner, you do it and your own pace. But if you ever decide to do so just trust me it feels relieving. But it’s just advice so take it as a grain of salt.

These are the stuff i wanted to say i broke up with my ex a few months ago, and now i feel better than ever i feel happier in life, i feel like i got closer with my friends and just started enjoy every single thing that happens. i hope everyone reading this wakes up one day and just starts feeling slightly better than the day before.",5,3,2025-06-28 21:11:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmxhqo/advice/,,,"Thank you for this, I hope I can do the same ||| solid message   but let’s be real—“they always regret it” isn’t the win   you feeling lighter, sharper, more *you*   that’s the real victory  forgiveness? yeah, it hits   but not as a gift to them   as a middle finger to the weight they left on you  keep building   not to prove a point   just to live a life where they’re not even the plot twist"

Breakup with bf of 3 years,"Forewarning, this is not a typical breakup post on here. I’m curious what everybody thinks as I’m at a loss.

Me (19M) and my bf (18M) just broke up after 3 years on and off together. I’m bi and he’s gay and have had our ups and downs. The past month was the absolute best of our relationship ever. Genuinely perfect. For context, he is a very faithful Christian and I am one trying to work on my faith. Earlier this week, he called me out of the blue in tears saying he might think being gay is a sin which caught me COMPLETELY off guard as we had never had a conversation like that. At first I thought it may have been related to lust as we have both struggled with it but it’s been great as of late (we’ve had a lot more self-control). He later realized he may have over reacted but feels that it may be a sin to be in a gay marriage and have gay sex. This was devestating to hear as he was the one who helped me come out and was my first long-term relationship. Tonight, he officially ended things and said he is struggling with his faith and needs to find answers. We are both Devestated and I feel for him that he is having these thoughts, but am simultaneously furious, sad, and confused. How should I move forward? I feel a sense of betrayal while also wondering if I’m on the wrong track? I don’t think a relationship in the future is off the table but I’m so confused as to what I should even do at this point.",1,0,2025-06-29 06:44:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln84sa/breakup_with_bf_of_3_years/,,,
My ex with likely BPD traits ended things harshly — now she wants to come back,"A few months ago, my ex ended our relationship with a cold, final message — telling me I wasn’t a relationship person and that I wasn’t her person. It was shocking, given how much I had shown up for her and how hard I’d worked to keep us afloat during some very difficult times. But deep down, I knew the relationship had become unsustainable.

There were repeated cycles of emotional volatility — fights that escalated quickly, intense accusations, rewriting of history, and a pattern where I was often made to feel like the bad guy no matter how carefully I tried to communicate. Over time, I began to suspect she might have undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. The extreme black-and-white thinking, fear of abandonment, and emotional intensity were all there. I say this with compassion: I don’t believe she wanted to hurt me, but the impact was real — I was walking on eggshells, constantly trying to prevent the next explosion.

After she ended things, I focused on healing. I didn’t reach out. I grieved, went to therapy, tried to rebuild some stability. And then, weeks ago, she reached out again with a long, emotional message. She told me she now realizes how much pain she caused, how often she misdirected her anger, and how unfair she was to me. She said she misses me and wants another chance. 

But alongside the emotional message, she also started asking for random items back — including things she had previously gifted me, some of which weren’t even particularly meaningful to me (like items from her old boss). I ended up coordinating two separate Uber courier trips to return everything.

I haven’t replied to the emotional part of her message. I told her I couldn’t give her an answer right now. I don’t know what to make of it. Part of me still loves her, and wonders if this is genuine growth. But I’m also deeply afraid of going back into the same emotionally chaotic cycle — even if she says she sees it now.

If you’ve been through a breakup with someone who might have BPD traits, did they ever come back with real change? Did you try again — and how did you know whether to trust it?

"I need advice. My ex [23M] betrayed me in a deeply personal way, and years later I [25F] still feel haunted. Is it wrong to want to reach out — just once?","This happened a few years ago, but it still lives in me in a way I haven’t been able to shake.

He wasn’t my first love, but he was my first LOVE. We were young — early college years — mostly long-distance, but very deeply connected. Or so I believed. He made me feel like I was his dream girl, like there was no one in his past, present, or future who could compare.

Toward the end of our relationship, he left me for his ex — someone who, I later learned, was more palatable to his very religious family (my family is religious too, just more on the moderate side). Their relationship didn’t last either though. Over time, I fell in love again — multiple times. So did he. We’re both in long-term, committed relationships now. And we haven’t spoken in years.

And yet… I still carry it.

What broke me wasn’t just that he left me. We stayed in contact for sometime and were honestly compatible even as friends. We've always had great chemistry and liked a lot of the same things.

It was what I found out afterward that killed me, through a mutual friend: he had shared intimate photos of me with people in his life. His friends. I never confronted him. I just removed him from my social media (the ones that count at least) and cut him off. He never reached out. Never asked why. Never apologized. And sometimes, I wonder if he even knows that I know. I wonder all the time, did he do it because he was just a child (he really was), or because he was and maybe still is just a horrible human being? And it's that question that leaves room in my heart to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

I’ve tried to give myself closure. I’ve journaled, processed, forgiven. And in many ways, I’ve healed. I’ve built a life I’m proud of — a career, a partner I respect, a community. A life he never touched. But there’s still this ache — a quiet, confusing mix of grief, disbelief, and, yes, longing. Not for reconciliation. Just for acknowledgment. To be seen. To be remembered. To be heard.

I know most people in my position wouldn’t give someone like that another second of thought. But I’ve prayed for it, ached for it, all this time. Not to relive the past — just to close the chapter with both eyes open.

Now here’s the hard part: I’m traveling to his city soon. Not for him — it’s just coincidence. I won’t call it fate. But it feels significant. Like the window I never had.

I don’t expect a real, life-changing, heartfelt conversation. I don’t want a reunion.
I just want to say — one time — I know what you did. I’ve grown. I forgave you even when you didn’t deserve it. And I hope you found what you were looking for.

Is that wrong?
Is it delusional to want to be remembered by someone who hurt you?
Is it selfish to need that last sliver of being seen — even after everything?

I know silence is the dignified way out.
But it still pulls at me.
And I’m tired of carrying this quietly.
Tired of biting my tongue.
Tired of always being the bigger person, hoping it’ll give us both peace.",1,0,2025-06-29 06:42:27,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln83wv/i_need_advice_my_ex_23m_betrayed_me_in_a_deeply/,,,
When’s the right time to start no contact?,"My ex and I were together for a year and 7 months and the first 7 months were solid. I thought she was the one… I even bought her a plane ticket to Japan for her birthday. 

So we’ve lived together for almost a year and that’s when I saw her true side. She has a lot of trauma that she took out on me, and was pretty manipulative in the relationship. Sadly, there was almost the same amount of good times as there were bad times. I just can’t shake off my love for her. She’s finally moving out but has been taking forever to get her stuff out. She said that she’ll have all of her stuff out by the end of the month so I hope she stays true to her word. 

I started up therapy and I was told to do no contact. Then she flipped out at me that I wasn’t responding and I felt bad. So we’ve been talking here and there,  still liking each others post and still viewing each others story’s but I need help… 

I need some guidance because this is my first time ever dealing with this. 
Once she’s fully moved out, is that when I completely cut her off?

Come the first do just that and block / remove her from EVERYTHING. Block any other number she may try to use or email address too. No contact means just that, nothing,zip, -0- like she doesn't exist. It's hard to do but you will get past her quicker without a constant reminder. Eventually you both will meet someone else and it saves the hurt of the other finding out, although you still may in time. The only place she will still be is in your memory's and those will fade with time."
Looking back with embarrassment at what I allowed myself to obsess over,"I have given up with the idea that we will ever get back together. I struggled with the breakup for months on end. He explained with many excuses that the reason we needed to break up is because he just couldn’t be in a relationship, he was busy, how I deserved better (he admitted on his own accord he no longer hung out or went on dates with me, didn’t remember my birthday, etc) and because of his actions that’s why he couldn’t be romantically attracted anymore. 

At the time it all made no sense to me. I was way busier than him yet still made time for him, meanwhile he was out nearly everyday with friends yet only could see me once a week.  How could someone say the reason they no longer want you is because they treat you bad? How do you recognize you treat me bad yet your answer is to discard of me when you could just be better?? He was the one to ask me to be his girlfriend. He pursued me first. He was really sweet and romantic at the start of the relationship. He went above and beyond on dates and was so kind. If he wasn’t attracted why did he bother pursuing me? I even met all his friends and family. What was the point if he was just going to ditch me after a few months? Then, it turns out he got a new girlfriend. This solidified every bit of closure I needed. It’s simple, he just didn’t like me.

I obsessed over this breakup. I let it eat me alive. I let it control my mind at every waking moment for months because I was so hopelessly in-love. He was my first boyfriend too. Yet he dropped me and moved on within no time. He has so many friends to keep him company and support him. I had to rebuild up from absolutely nothing

But even his friends said I could do better. It gnaws at me how much I humiliated myself by dating him. And even allowing myself to get to this point where I was obsessed over a guy who didn’t even care if I lived or died. This has me seriously questioning everything I think I built up in terms of self esteem, self worth, self respect. My pride and ego are completely shattered. I begged someone to love me, at which they rejected SEVERAL times. I don’t even know how to heal my pride from here. I have dishonored myself horribly. I don’t even want to get back together. I want to regain back all the dignity I lost. ",1,0,2025-06-29 06:36:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln80cj/looking_back_with_embarrassment_at_what_i_allowed/,,,
To be wanted again,"I wish to be seen again.

I comes a point in the process where you are mostly sure they wont come back, but you dont see the light at the end of the tunnel either, and the greatest feeling is loneliness. So lonely it hurts, no one to kiss, to hug, to talk to as freely as you talked to them.

You feel unwanted, as no one will ever look at you like that, and since you've been in a relationship for so long, you in some point lost your ability to start talking to someone too, and to be honest you dont have the energy to do it either.

She called me “sick” for loving her.,"I feel like I'm stabbed but I'm not bleeding..

I was in a relationship with a girl for 9 months  from May 2024 to January 2025.

She had thoughts, ideas and interests that matched mine in a rare way. she said i love you and showed hypersexual signs to me but i like it anyway she was perfect to me someone I could build a life with and she felt like home

… she changed.
Her replies got dry. She stopped showing emotion. She was accusing me of cheating but she made it to look like she is joking 
and doesn't give a f*ck about long or deep talks anymore..
So I stepped back and gave her space.

Then in March, I watched a movie that touched my heart..It reminded me of her ...Of us it was about fate and i was believing that the fate will get us again perfectly together cause we are soulmates in my mind. So I texted her and she ignored me.

I was romantic. I felt hopeless, but I kept trying From April up until yesterday 
 I tried to get back the connection at least i need to be a good person to her if she was thinking that i am a cheater i need to clear my name 

Yesterday felt like a bullet hit my head...

A guy texted me told me that he is her fiancé
And i better never try to talk to her again 

It crushed me... I felt angry
I couldn’t understand how someone I imagined forever with could move on like I never mattered

So I texted her. Not to beg — but to tell her how the past few months felt and How surprised I am by her treatment of me
I even told her if she had just been honest and told me she was seeing someone else, I would’ve backed off and not trying to get her again 

And then… she replied.
She called me sick.
Said I was crazy, annoying, and that she doesn’t respect me anymore for what i am sending to her and I should have left her alone when she didn't reply to my text messages and i am not different than others that bother random girls.. what the hell i am reading.. i felt a stranger not a lover boy not anymore 
She said she “respects her new guy now” and doesn’t want to cause problems in her relationship.

And to make sure i did read it 
She copy-pasted the same harsh message on both WhatsApp and Instagram then she blocked me 

I’m full of anger, humiliation, and grief —
Not just because I lost her,
But because the perfect love story I was building in my mind disappeared in a blink.
She turned my love into something shameful.
She made it feel like a curse. A weakness. A disease that she can't handle 

How could someone showed love, passion and sex
Turn so heartless?
To be brutally cruel to someone loves her truly 

I still don’t get it.
But I needed to get this out.

It's better to move on without her and it's harsh when someone you really attached to suddenly turns something you really don't want to see. I suggest going to NC and I don't know if you also told her fiance that she said she loves you and flirted with you. If not I think it's worth telling him with that with evidence.
Mutual breakup: never recieved a call after breakup,"I broke up with my girlfriend in 2024. It's been 10 months. It felt really hard at the beginning since we talk daily.  We spoke about our feelings once per week in the first month.

Later, she decided that we should not talk anymore. She told me it will help us move on from each other. I agreed. 

I missed her a lot and called her once per month. I regretted everytime I made a call. She literally asked me to be strong and stop wasting my life. I get that I need to move forward in my life.

What surprises me was that she never called after the first month of breakup. It was me reaching out to her all the time.

I 39M can’t bring myself to leave my relationship with my 38F GF of 3 years ( or any other serious LTR ),"I 39M Can’t bring myself to leave my GF 38F ( or any serious past relationships either )

Me - 39M
GF - 38F
Together for 3 years

TLDR: My LTR partner isn’t right for me, and I just cannot bring myself to end it. It feels so incredibly scary and panically frightening to actually go through with it. It’s like I need to be physically cheated on to leave, that is one line I cannot overlook being crossed. I did this same thing with my ex wife, knew she wasn’t the right one for me, told her that I wasn’t in love with her the way she was with me, but she continued to grip tighter, pressured me into marriage, and we divorced 17 years later. Not sure how to get through this.

Title says it all, I simply cannot bring myself to break up with my partner.

We have been together for 3 years and she just isn’t right for me in too many ways. The signs have been there for a long time, but I just continue to ignore them. We aren’t compatible in some extremely important ways, and she is also abusive verbally and emotionally as well. I’m not saying that our relationship is “all” negative, but I need to let it go, and I just simply have not been able too.

I did this almost 20 years ago with my ex wife, and ended up staying together with her and married for almost 17 years. I knew she wasn’t the one, I knew she didn’t speak to my heart the way that was true to me, I tried to tell her I didn’t feel the same way. Heck I didn’t try, I did tell her that. But she held on even tighter. She pushed to get married and we did, she told me she figured I would catch up in the “feelings department”. She was head over heels for me, love of her life. We stayed married for a long time, grew a life, grew a family, but eventually that gnawing feeling just wouldn’t go away. That I was never truly in love with her the way I wanted to be.

We eventually divorced.

I’ve found myself in this other relationship for 3 years now. I’ve known for the majority of the relationship that she isn’t right for me, that we aren’t compatible in some really key ways. That I need to let this go and learn to be on my own and love myself fully, learn to be comfortable being with me, before I can know who I truly want to be with.

But I just can’t ever bring myself to truly break up, to fully let go and move on, with just me.

The loneliness, the depression that sets in being alone and not being involved in a romantic relationship. The disconnection from the world that I feel when I’m not paired with a partner, whether we are right for each other or not, whether they are right for me or not.

It’s the one big thing, psychologically, that I haven’t been able to solve in my life.

Even now, this relationship that hasn’t been good for me for a long while, but I just can’t bring myself to end it. It just feels unfathomable for my brain. The fear and just straight panic and other worldly “weight” of actually ending it, is almost, or is, too much to bear.

It’s like I need to be cheated on to end it. That’s the one line I cannot allow to be crossed.

But they never let go, she never lets go, and I don’t let go.

I don’t know what to do about this, or how to understand it better, why I simply cannot bring myself to end any semi good relationship in my life.

I realize at this point it has to be something to do with my childhood at least partly, and the other part I think has to do with the mental health struggles I experience when riding “solo” in regards to having no romantic relationship to be in.

Has anyone ever felt like this, dealt with this, or even possibly grown through this and found the other side?

I do hope one day I find my answers and my healing that I need to find. Otherwise I will simply always settle for the next best “good enough” ( even though it really isn’t good enough ) relationship I can find to hold onto. I don’t want to live like this forever.

I want to live my life on my own terms, and only bring someone else into it that I choose because they enhance my life in a positive and healthy way, and not to avoid out of fear, or fill a gap inside of me.

I hope one day I find that inside of myself, and I hope that maybe this resonates with someone else, and they might be able to give some insight into their story, or their thoughts on the matter.

Miss my ex,Broke up with my ex a little under a year ago. The main reason for me was I wasn’t sure about my sexuality and felt I needed to figure it out. For her I don’t think she was as ready to break up but was struggling with some mental health issues. since then I’ve explored and ultimately feel like I had something solid and regret the decision deeply. I know I needed to figure it out but it feels like it came at too heavy a cost. Since the breakup she has moved a state over. We haven’t spoken in about 8 months. I’ve strongly considered sending a letter but I feel like it may be pointless considering we live in different places now and that she may have moved on. I just hate living with the feeling of regret and not knowing what could’ve been. So ultimately unsure if I just move on or try reaching out.,2,2,2025-06-29 02:15:38,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln3n9o/miss_my_ex/,,,"Reaching out is absolutely not something you should feel bad about. It does come with its risks of course, if the feels aren't mutual you'll probably go through another little spell of grief.   It really comes down to if the risk if that outweighs your worry about the regrets you may have if you don't.   Take some time to think on it, be kind to yourself, and see if the fear of those regrets stays. Maybe discuss it with a councillor, and then if the feels aren't mutual at least you will have a net ready to catch you.   Hope that helps! ||| if it really is weighing down on you. you should."

Does it get better??,"It’s been exactly a month since the break up.

We were together throughout highschool since freshman year, broke up right before graduation.  She was upset that I wasn’t prioritizing her, but I was so busy working to keep myself afloat that I became distant from her, not because I wanted to but because I had no energy for anyone, not even myself. Unfortunately we talked about it too late, I tried to fix things. 

God knows I tried, but she said she was too hurt by how I had acted and she didn’t know what she wanted to do, after weeks of trying, I told her I understood if she didn’t want to be together, she said thank you and that’s the last time we talked. 

She was my very first everything first love first kiss anything you can think of, we were beyond happy together, we talked about how many kids we wanted, their names, where we were gonna grow old together, what type of house, I never imagined a future without her. She was my everything. 

Towards the last six months of the relationship it did get choppy, because I was working sm, I communicated less, so I guess I can see how she felt, I’m just really hurt. The worst part is that I quit that job a few weeks before the break up, I was so excited to finally dedicate time to her, I was planning dates and things and everything. It pains me I was ready to dedicate sm time to her now I’m alone. 


Now I’m in my room alone listening to the smiths drowning in my sorrows, I’m just thinking does it get better??? Every night has just been full of regret and pain, can anyone tell me if it gets better??? Will I always feel this pain???  I’ve never felt pain like this, is this just life?

What do I even do?,"My ex partner (23m) broke up with me (23f) about a month ago.

We still keep contact and I’ve told him my intentions with where our relationship lies and I’ll give him as much time as he needs but he says “idk” to every question I’ve asked him. 

He’s stated himself that he misses me and I love this man with my entire being but I can’t handle all the emotional whiplash. It’s making me go insane. He pulls back whenever he gets a sense of relief/comfort or something. I feel we’re perfect together because things just flow so naturally without any force but I can’t MAKE him want to be with me again.

I dont want to get a disease,"I have been hooking up with my ex. He dumped me in April of last year. We have hooked up off and on ever since. He told me the other day when we were hanging out that he is currently sleeping with several women. I did not know this. I'm disgusted and hope I don't get a disease. He actually said.. it's not the other people I'm worried about getting something from its you. I do not sleep with any one else so I don't know why he would say that. Then he got drunk and started to hit me. He gave me a black eye. I was crying and asking him to please stop. I don't know why he did it. My family was like who hit you and I made up a story because they already don't like him. I know I ne3d to stop seeing him maybe even go no contact change my number block him really do what I should have done all along. I don't know why I do this to myself. For context, he has slapped me during sex before and I never had a problem with it. But this time he went too far and punched me in the face hard. I wasn't having fun. It wasn't foreplay or sex or whatever it was supposed to be. I seriously do not know. But him coming clean about how many people he is currently sleeping with makes me feel so bad I can't even explain it. All of this is my own damn fault. I never had any self respect. Of course he treats me like garbage. I have never demanded anything better. Please don't judge me. I love him very much. I loved him so much. When he dumped me it devastated me. I've been trying to move on ever since. I almost did forget about him but then he pulled me back in. I don't know what to do.

"5 Weeks dating, blew it, when you know, you know.","30m, after a four week whirlwind of dating someone new and falling hard for each other, I blew it. Context is important here: 

* Ex-wife divorced me under a year of being married and over 8 years together. 
* She had BPD and a range of issues, I also ran out of patience and lost emotional bandwidth to deal with them. 
* She developed emotional affair. Asked for divorce, and then proceeded to bang the guy she told me not to worry about. 
* Mentally, this broke me right up, a bunch of trust issues, feelings of emasculation, and a bunch of trauma that I worked through over the next 18 months, or so I thought. 
* We still kept in contact, me thinking I was taking the high ground, in reality I've come to realise I was stuck in a horrific trauma-loop. Where I was so embarrassed about the situation, the constant calls and my stuck feelings of duty to this person that I would hide behind false-justifications: 'We're just friends', it's fine there's no issue between us, I want the best for her, and it takes maturity to move on past divorce and formulate a friendship - Even to write this infuriates me. 

Enter new woman: 

* An amazing soul with immense emotional maturity and personal growth. 
* Hyper-independent, someone who didn't necessarily need me, but wanted to spend time with me. 
* Great conversations, similar interests, off-the charts s\*xual chemistry. 
* Someone who appreciated all of the parts of me that I was insecure about.  
* Someone who I realised, was enough for me to change my behaviours with my Ex (yes reddit I know I should have done this a long time ago, hence unhealed). 
* This new woman, was the perfect match for me in every single aspect, when you know, you know. 

The issues

* I subconsciously wasn't paying attention to the significance of keeping in contact with my ex. I was stuck in a loop of an unhealed trauma bond and as a result, downplayed the seriousness of the situation to the new girl because I knew if she found out the truth she'd think less of me. This fear of rejection and anxiety I understand stems from an unhealthy need for approval, which I never received in my marriage. 
* I told her that the ex and I were just friends, and I didn't see anything wrong with calls with my ex every other couple of days. This was 'normal' to me. I recognise this was my co-dependency, falling into the same habits and routine, not for a desire to get back together with her, but because I was addicted to the highs and lows of the control she had over me. 
* Ultimately I was so entangled in my brain I'd convinced myself that this was perfectly normal, my ex-wife was my first everything, so even breaking up was new for me. 
* I made the decision to stay in contact, full well knowing it was unhealthy because I was ignorant. As frustrating as it is to admit, all the counselling and self-development work aside. I didn't have the guts to go no-contact with my ex. 

The conflict

* I projected onto the new girl that this wasn't going to be an issue. Yet I constantly brought up my ex-wife and the 'friendship' as if the new girl needed constant reassurance. In reality this was me self-justifying. 
* I mislead the new girl into thinking that the friendship I had with the ex wasn't serious. Whereas in reality I now see speaking every few days is unhealthy as well. 
* I didn't ask to break of the communication with the ex until after I met the new girl. 

This all came to a head after I was vulnerable in sharing with the new girl that the ex and I were no-contact and I felt like a massive weight was lifted off my shoulders. 

* New girl asked a bunch of questions about: how often were we in contact (every few days), prior to a week ago when communication was cut, what were the types of conversations we were having (How's the shared pet, work going), when the last time we slept together was (8 weeks ago). 
* The above lead to her expressing her upset over the fact I was still basically in a relationship that hadn't been severed, even though I had no intention to get back with my ex (the sex was a once off, discussed, drunken mistake, prior to meeting new girl). 
* She then explained that she felt manipulated and mislead, that I downplayed the constant communication with my ex (I did), and it's made her question everything about the relationship we'd formed. 

What I've learned

* I was in an unhealthy, unhealed trauma bond with my ex wife. I am disappointed in myself for the new relationship being a freaking awful lesson in self-development and healing. 
* Do not get into something new, thinking that you can heal yourself at the same time. Even though the divorce was my first breakup, I didn't know how to act. I'm learning to forgive myself that the unhealthy pattern I was stuck in wasn't normal. 
* I should have been more honest with myself about the unhealthy level of communication I had with my ex wife. I knew I didn't want to have it, I didn't have the maturity to speak up about it. 
* I caught the new girl in the crossfire, and she didn't deserve that. She didn't need to hear any of this in the first place, I could have elected to not say anything at all. My insecurities and trauma just overshared so early on inside this new relationship, and I hurt her badly. 

 Reflection: 

* The new girl has asked for time and space to process all of this. Ultimately we've only been together for 5 weeks, but 3-4 times per week has made things move fast. 
* This is a core boundary of hers that I feel I've crossed by misleading her about the situation. 
* I have taken the steps to continue with therapy, and acknowledge my own issues with the fact that I was unhealed. 
* No-contact is so peaceful without constantly having to worry about being called by my ex. I feel like I can finally heal. 
* New girl and I had same mutual feelings for each other, and everything else aligned in terms of what we wanted to do / be together. 

I need advice 

* I do believe that falling on my sword here is the fairest outcome. This new girl deserves peace and love from someone that is fully-healed. Regardless of how strong we felt about each other. 
* As much as it pains me to ask, can anyone offer insight into how to heal from a trauma bond outside of the normal therapist-style input? 
* Can anyone also offer some words of wisdom? I have dated a few people over the last two years, but in my entire lifetime I've only fallen in love and connected with 2 women. How do you navigate the feelings of fear that your luck has run out? 
* I want to do my healing and learn from this, but I still do want to reach out to this girl down the track. Even if she's not open to reconciling, am I still allowed to retain a value of mine which is I believe if two people feel strongly about each other, and want to make things work, they should?",1,0,2025-06-29 05:29:02,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln6yk4/5_weeks_dating_blew_it_when_you_know_you_know/,,5 week(s),

Thursday she came to pick me up for a weekend together. Everything was packed and ready and boom she announced it. We had no such fights or arguments in months so it was really unexpected. We were together for 14 months. 

I dont want to get back to her and i am fine with the breakup. I am meeting her today to collect my stuff from her place. I am a bit anxious seeing her.

That which I do eat is a fraction of what I used to eat. ||| Brother, I’m going through the same thing — and I promise you, this will help instantly. My relationship with my avoidant ex was an intense, trauma-bonded rollercoaster that lasted 3 years. If you're struggling right now, please do these few things. I promise you — you’ll feel like a whole new man within days.  1. Acceptance  Accept the reality of the situation. Let her go — not for her, but for you. The universe (or God, or whatever higher power you believe in) removed her from your life because your values no longer aligned. That person is not meant to walk into your future. More importantly, accept that it was a trauma bond. That intensity? That chaos? That high followed by a crash? That wasn’t love — it was trauma re-enactment. Read ""The Trauma Bond Cure"" by Davis Kellie. It will open your eyes.  2. Surrender  Stop resisting what is. Surrender — to the heartbreak, the silence, the confusion. Stop putting in effort toward someone who constantly made you feel unwanted. Every time you tried, it pushed them further away. Let go. And tell yourself this: “I now surrender to a higher power, and I trust that the right person — someone who aligns with my values — will come into my life.”  3. Calm Your Nervous System  Right now, your nervous system is in withdrawal. Not just from the comfort she gave you — but from the pain she caused too. Your body has become addicted to the highs and lows. It’s like coming off a drug. You need a detox. Breathe. Sleep well. Journal. Walk. Meditate. Don’t consume more drama. Let your body re-learn what calm feels like.  4. Spend Time with People Who Love You Unconditionally  This is the most important step — if you do nothing else, do this. Go to the people who truly love you: your parents, your siblings, your childhood friends. Open up. Be vulnerable. Cry. Let them hold you like you’re 10 years old again. Stay with them for 1–3 days. Wake up with them. Eat with them. Be part of their routine. Let their unconditional love remind your nervous system what safety really feels like.   Do this for just one week — and I promise you, you will start to detach. Your heart will begin to heal. You’ll feel stronger. You’ve got this, brother. Go do this. Then come back and tell me how you feel. I’m rooting for you. 💙 ||| you’re in the withdrawal stage   body’s freaking out, not because you want *her* back   but because it lost the routine of having her around  few things that help lock you back into your system:  * **eat tiny, bland meals** even if you're not hungry toast, rice, soup—get something in your brain can’t regulate emotions when it’s starving * **sleep hygiene 101** no screens 1 hour before bed cold room, white noise, same sleep/wake time if you wake up anxious, don’t lie there spiraling get up, write down what’s in your head, then try again * **walk daily** no music, no podcast—just walk let your thoughts untangle in motion * **don’t overanalyze attachment stuff right now** it helps later but right now it just feeds the mental loop you’re not broken, you’re just hurting  [**NoFluffWisdom Newsletter**](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) has grounded takes on mental resets and bouncing back from emotional chaos worth a peek ||| Me just started losing appetite starting today . ||| Unfortunately eating and sleeping won’t be easy for a while.

ADHD ruined my relationship,"I ruined my relationship 3 months ago because I had undiagnosed ADHD and absolutely tormented my ex. Initially lying about stuff and then impulsively going through her phone, which eroded her trust and caused her to check out. I became codependent. She monkeybranched to a new relationship with a coworker. 

I chased and obsessed over her this last month, previously giving her space and keeping limited contact because we were both studying for finals and my behavior in the first month post breakup was horrible and I didn’t want to act like that anymore.

When I last saw her two days ago I apologized for my behavior, being a bad partner and how it cost us our relationship and that if she ever felt differently that she should let me know. Her reply was a somber “Okay.”

I found out about my ADHD induced codependency just a few hours ago and do not know what to do. There’s nothing more I can say or do to get her back now. How can I ever reconcile with her? She was nigh-perfect.

Are men really this ridiculous?,"Me and my boyfriend of 8 months recently broke up and I'm so confused. I'm literally so hurt over it and it's so weird bc i was compeltely fine when we actually broke up. I missed him and wanted to give him another chance the same day I officially broke things off, but I didn't bc i knew it was the right thing to just continue off without him. He's so selfish, and childish, like really we couldn't continue this relationship bc he needed me to be his girlfriend but also be in check of ALL of his emotions and entire life (like I'm literally only one person) so after our third breakup I just decided to end things. Things were fine, I felt kinda free and I found my peace again. Until i found out he got with the same girl that I was worried he was cheating on me with/lying about during our breakup??? Now nothing fucking makes sense. He tried so many times to get back together with me, to each time I kept denying and saying no... and tried so hard for DAYS to get back together wtih me and give him a chance just to turn around adn do this shady shit behind my back?? It literally makes no fucking sense.  
  
Anyway, since finding out they're together I've been extremely depressed. I was relatively sad after the breakup but it wasn't as intense as how I've feeling for the past week. All I want to do is reach back out to him and reconstruct things, but I know it's wrong. I truly miss him but at the same time I don't want anything to do with him. He completely broke my trust by lying about the relationship he had with a girl he knew I was worried about when we were still kinda together, and I don't know if I'm allowed to even be mad because well, we're not dating.. but you know, that's fucking shady. We just broke up, and he's already in another relationship as if the one we worked so hard to preserve meant absolutely nothing. I'm fucking broken, I'm genuinely so depressed and I go to bed thinking of him, have constant dreams of him, and then wake up thinking about him too. When I go out in public, almost everything reminds me of him. It's as if I'm being haunted by him and I fucking hate it. All I want is to forget about him, and all of this, and to know nothing more about him or his life ever again.  
  
Like truly it's all so crazy to me, his rls before mine was literally insane and she cheated on him at every chance she got, yet with me I was overly loyal and he was still traumatized/scared which was reasonable but sometimes it genuinely felt like he couldn't trust me at all which was so weird because I really did try my hardest to give him a safe space and let him know he can trust me. But, for him to pull this shady shit, of all people? Like fuck youuuu wtf😭 But can anyone help me like get over him and at least let me know that his new relationship isn't some shit I should worry about. Honestly I feel he doesn't rlly love her and that his lust got the best of him and he just with another girl to be with a girl, given he just got together with her and they literally met a few weeks ago bye.. But I really just want to forget about him, and I hate him so much but also really miss him and the bond we had. We were really good friends and I wish we could've stayed friends because he was a cool ass guy n we had a shit ton in common, but knowing I can't even like be his friend anymore hurts me too, even though I hate him and hope he fuckin burns 😭.  
  
Lastly, it really hurts that I have absolutely no one to turn to. I feel like my friends and mom are kinda tired of me constantly talking about this, and I only have one or two friends to talk to anyway and they don't have a lot to say. My mom is really sweet and notices how depressed I am and I rlly hate being so depressed about it. I want to go back to normal and be happy but it just feels like I can't, and I don't want to be depressed all summer anymore. My birthday's next week so I can try to enjoy that at least. But that's probably why I miss him so much. We talked, all day, every single day, about everything. Now, I have no one to share my stories with. No one to talk about my day with. No one to update about anything, no one to show my hauls, nobody. I truly need more friends lol. I never realized just how little friendships I had until I lost him, and realizing that I lost the only person who actively checked in on me hurts like hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I think im mostly depressed because he stayed with me through my entire, busy, crazy school year where I barely had time to spend with him, and now that I do have the time of course we're broken up. Now that I have time to do any and everything, I have no one to do it with and no one to talk to. That definitely hurts the most paired with knowing I can't reconstruct our friendship at the very least.",3,2,2025-06-28 23:10:04,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln01ho/are_men_really_this_ridiculous/,,,"you’re not missing *him*   you’re missing the routine   the attention   the built-in audience for your life  but let’s be real—this dude wasn’t stable   he couldn’t handle his own baggage and dumped it all on you   you weren’t in a relationship   you were in a babysitting gig with bonus gaslighting  he ran to that other girl because it’s easier to start new than grow up   and you dodged the bullet   painful, yes   but freedom doesn’t always feel good at first  right now you don’t need closure   you need connection   new friendships, new distractions, new anchors   start building those   don’t wait for the ache to fade—outgrow it  the [**NoFluffWisdom Newsletter**](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) has sharp takes on rebuilding after emotional chaos and getting unstuck   solid mindset fuel if you’re ready to climb ||| Women are more ridiculous"

How do I make myself ‘want to move on’.,"Two months ago my ex broke up with me for good, she tried a week before that but I managed to persuade her to do a break instead as she was very overwhelmed and burnt out (we are both autistic), and i wanted to work on our issues together and do better, not break up. During the break she said she wanted to no contact for a ‘few days’ and then ignored me for a week, whilst I was going frantically researching healthy relationships and autism, adhd, attachment theory, trying to find solutions to our problems and our issues. I found alot, and learnt alot about being a better partner. I realised that I needed to primarily empathise and ask ‘how did you feel’ when I make a mistake to deliver a real apology etc. (i would put emphasis on explaining that i didn’t intend to hurt them) (alot of our arguments were to do with me being blunt and honest, and her also perceiving things as criticism which were not). Anyways, after the ‘few days’ the no contact continued and I started to wonder if she would ever respond, and eventually after a week of me going almost insane, she broke up with me over text, giving the usual faux reasoning ‘work on myself’, ‘focus on career’, ‘being hurt’ etc. 3 weeks prior she said I was her autistic favourite person alongside her mum. I respected her wishes, and wished her the best, although i said i was upset at her for doing it over text. I then reached out after a few days seeking closure and understanding how I had hurt her, I presumed it was my blunt manner. Silence. I repeated breaking no contact many times, as I genuinely believed she was the loml, and had so many great qualities and we got along so well in person, and i really believed we could’ve worked through our minor issues. We just had poor conflict resolution, prevention, and she held resentment towards me. She is the first person I have ever met that I really thought I could marry (i am very picky), and I am so confused as to why she ignored me after I sent her a letter apologising taking accountability after I learnt about mistakes I may have made, reached out for closure, reached out to ask how she felt, reached out to ask how my mistakes made her feel, say sorry etc. Silence. I don’t understand why she would do this. She is also an FA leaning avoidant, and I am either an anxious, or FA leaning anxious. I had to block her after 2 weeks of being ignored to prevent myself from reaching out to give her space, which i explained in order to not confuse her and show it was my lack of temperance that led me to block her, not her behaviour. Then I unblocked her as I said I would once I had felt I could control my emotions and not reach out when upset or wanting to take accountability/check in etc. it has been 2 months since we split, 5-6 weeks  since I blocked her, 3 weeks since I unblocked her. Her birthday is in a week and a half, I feel I have to make a choice, I also want to let her know that I still want to give her a proper apology and understand how I hurt her with my blunt words. I am really really heartbroken and confused, and I don’t know what to do or how to help myself move on, because I don’t want to move on.",3,1,2025-06-28 23:07:29,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmzzl1/how_do_i_make_myself_want_to_move_on/,,,"you don’t need to *want* to move on   you just need to accept that it’s already happening  she made her choice   not once, but repeatedly   and every time you reach out, you’re not seeking closure—you’re chasing the version of her that only existed in your head  you did the work   you learned, you apologized, you owned your flaws   and she still chose silence   that’s not a cue to try harder   that’s your exit sign  you can’t beg someone into growth   you can only grow past them  the [**NoFluffWisdom Newsletter**](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) gets raw about emotional detachment and rebuilding after obsessive loops like this   you need that kind of clarity right now"
Should I move on or rebuild? 21M and 21F. Completely shattered.,"Hey Reddit, this is gonna be long, but I seriously need some unbiased perspectives.

Me (21M) and my ex (21F), both Indians, were in a relationship for 1 year and 4 months. It was deep. It was real. We weren’t just boyfriend and girlfriend — we planned *everything* together. From naming our future kids, to our careers, to even building startups together. Our entire lives were woven around each other.

But two weeks back, things crumbled. It started because I failed to show up for her during a really stressful day (her boarding a train alone and later her internship prep). I was genuinely sick but looking back, I do realize I should’ve been there emotionally, at least through calls. That moment planted hurt in her that I didn’t realize grew this big.

Fast forward, last Wednesday, she told me the love is gone. Said she doesn’t feel the same anymore. Even told me brutal stuff like — *“Even if we married, I’d probably cheat on you. I wouldn’t even want to sleep in the same bed.”* — Hearing that from someone who once called me *‘my hubby’* every day absolutely destroyed me.

I’m not gonna sugarcoat it — I’m an emotional guy. I loved her with everything. The late-night calls, the morning texts, the teasing, the intimacy — everything felt like home. Now, her Signal profile (we shifted to Signal to have our own private space) feels like a graveyard of memories. Photos, chats, our startup plans — all just sitting there haunting me.

My parents are secretly relieved that we broke up. Even some of her friends seem okay with it. But me? I still love her. Deeply. But also… I’m terrified. Terrified of getting back and ending up broken again. She gave up once. What if she does it again?

She asked for time until Monday — to decide whether she wants to rebuild or cut everything off for good. Part of me wants her back like crazy. Part of me screams to walk away because I deserve better than being an option. I’m stuck. Badly.

If she says *“I need time”* on Monday, I’m confused about whether I should accept that or just close the chapter permanently.  
If she says *“Let’s rebuild”* — should I even trust that? Or am I signing up to get hurt again?

The pain of imagining her doing the things we did — kissing, cuddling, even being physically intimate — with someone else someday is honestly tearing me to pieces. But I also know that’s not a reason to stay where I’m not wanted.

Just wanna know from those who’ve been through this:  
→ Is love after it’s broken ever the same?  
→ Is giving time healthy or just prolonging the pain?  
→ Am I being stupid for still hoping?

Any advice. Any perspective. Anything. I’ll take it.

**PS: I’m NOT asking Reddit to decide for me. I just wanna hear how others see this. I know the decision has to be mine.**

"I 39M feel bad about the way I am initiating break up with my GF 38F, but I feel it’s necessary.","Me - 39M
GF - 38F
Together for 3 years

TLDR: I feel bad about the way I’m breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years. I’ve got my small amount of furniture ( couch, grill, dresser ) to be sold on Monday while she is at work, have a breakup text written up, and will sell my things, pack my car, send the text and be gone before she gets home. I hate to do it this way, but she can be very emotionally unstable, and has put me in very compromising positions in the past ( calling police to get me in trouble over no wrongdoing ) and very easily loses control with no boundaries when emotionally triggered. It isn’t how I prefer to handle this, but I feel, for my safety, safe passage and right to do with my property ( furniture ) what I choose, I must handle the breakup covertly to assure no attempts are made at me to damage me in one way or the other on my way out the door.

I’m going to try to condense this as much as possible to avoid writing a novel.

I’m trying to understand if the way I’m choosing to break up with my girlfriend is extremely shitty, or understandably justified.

Long story short, we just aren’t compatible in a number of really important ways. Financially, parenting, values. But I think above all else, I simply cannot work through the emotional instability from her side any longer. We honestly have 2 different relationships that I’m essentially in with two different people. One side of her, she’s sweet and nice, amicable and a pleasure to spend time with.

On the other side, she is a nasty nasty person, who is mean, abusive, manipulating and damaging. And she turns into this person at the flip of a switch.

The other night, I was given a half of a protein bar at work, it was a wafer type bar, not very filling. Her daughter asked me what it was when I got home, I told her, and I proceeded to eat half of it before dinner.

Mind you, I was absolutely starving, and this little bit of food did not affect my appetite at all. My gf had just cooked dinner and I planned to ( and did ), eat an entire large plate, which was very good.

However, once she saw me eating the half of the protein bar, she got visibly upset, and started throwing me an attitude about me eating that just prior to eating dinner.

I understood where she was coming from, and I assured her that I was still very hungry, and that I had full intentions on eating a full plate of food for dinner.

But this is where things normally go haywire, instead of that moment happening, and being resolved and over with, as I mentioned, I still ate a full plate of dinner, she proceeded to go on a multi day personality flip stemming from this one moment. She turned into the rude, cold, short mannered, distant, unloving and intermittently disrespectful person she turns into over any singular thing that sends her spiraling. She finally snapped out of it this morning on day 3, when I declined to go on a planned event to the springs that we had planned all weekend, because I was just tired of being treated poorly, and when bringing it up to her last night, she proceeded to finish the crappy convo on her end with” I’ll just see you when I get home tomorrow “ essentially disinviting me from our set plans that we’ve had for a week now, all because I’ve been hurt and upset at how she’s been treating me since the “protein bar” incident. She basically told me, if you know I’m this person and you know I’m not going to care when you bring this up to me about how I’m acting, then why do you waste your time in doing so.

So this morning, I declined to go, and once she left the house, and I was not with her, it’s typically things like this that “snap” her back into reality and her feet come back down to earth and she checks back in. She started texting me, pleading with me to come, but I declined. She’s been checked back in ever since, and been nice all day. But unfortunately the timer has just begun for the next event 3-4 days from now that will send her spiraling again, and we will continue this Jykll and Hyde relationship where it feels like I’m with two different people.

So, back to the main reason for this post. I plan to break up with her on Monday. I have a friend that has said I can come stay with them, and I have my couple items of furniture set to be sold and picked up on Monday during the day while she is at work ( couch, grill, dresser ) ( I’m leaving my other very nice dresser for her daughter and leaving my queen bed set for her son ), and have a text written up to her to send once the items are sold and my car is packed. I’ve already got the rest of my items ready to go, I’ve went through the house and gathered all my things, and have them set aside in the garage in a non conspicuous way.

I feel crappy doing the breakup like this, but I cannot trust the crazy side of her. The part of her that gets triggered to the mean version of her, is scary. She’s called the police on me before for absolutely nothing, tells me things like our daughter isn’t mine and that she cheated on me and got pregnant, takes my phone from me, shuts my phone line off so I can’t use it, locks me out of the house so I can’t get it, and just isn’t someone I can trust at all when things aren’t going well.

I feel the only certain option that I have to be able to properly take care of the things that are rightfully mine, peacefully gather my belongings, and avoid a potentially messy breakup convo are to do it this way.

The thing is, I feel bad, because I don’t want to hurt the girl that is much more kind ( compatibility issues aside ), but I honestly have no idea which version of her I’ll be dealing with, and the “not nice” version of her is, simply put, ruthless and fucking crazy.

Just looking for some perspective on this and was curious of everyone’s thoughts on how I’m going to proceed with initiating the “break up”.

will he regret it?,"I think i would believe he would regret breaking up with me more if im not afraid of the girl he got with immediately after is going to treat him better not that I treated him bad just that he likes her more than me and is glad he left me.

but I dont know. I really really believed that he'd regret this one day way more strongly in the beginning but I think as time goes on I feel more weak and hurt by this.

although I strongly believe he left me because he couldn't take accountability for his actions and instead of fixing the problems we had he shifted the blame onto me and that I was ""insecure ""not confident"" even tho he in no way supported me or cared for me in a way that would result in a confident or secure girlfriend. im kinda riding on the thought that he won't change for her and the same problems will likely occur in their relationship, and that he will breakup up with her because he just cant be met with things hes doing wrong, he never fixes it or apologizes. who knows. I just hate that he left me with all this emotional weight and I hate that I feel like he can just move on so fast and easy from this when I know this left a permanent scar for me.

everyday im just more worried that he isn't going to regret what he did or miss me in some way. especially since he immediately got into a new relationship, while wanting to be on good terms with me. this isnt because I would take him back but it just would feel good to know hes feeling pain and remorse for all the pain and hurt hes caused me, over and over again.",1,4,2025-06-29 04:56:54,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln6fqi/will_he_regret_it/,,,"Almost one year after the break up here.

Met up with my ex and it felt like a date. What does this mean?,"TLDR:
Dated my ex for 2 years, almost proposed, but poor communication and misaligned expectations led to a painful breakup. She moved on fast with a new guy. Months later, we met up unexpectedly and ended up talking for 2.5 hours — laughing, crying, holding hands, and reminiscing. I told her I’d still take her back and start over, but she’s “seeing a good man” (said while crying). Now I’m wondering — was that closure, or is there still something there?


So here's my story, Reddit. I genuinely want to hear outside perspectives because this one’s been stuck in my head.

My ex (F23) and I (M23) were together for almost 2 years. We lived together, had long-term plans, and I was even ready to propose on a cruise — I had the ring picked out and everything. But in the months leading up to that moment, things felt off. She was applying to grad school but didn’t really include me in the process. It started to feel like I was expected to orbit around her goals, and I didn’t know where I truly fit in her future. I hesitated, and didn’t go through with the proposal — something she noticed.

For context, I’m in a rotational program for work where I move around the country while getting my master’s. One option was Florida, which I mentioned as a great opportunity (especially since she’s always said she hates Ohio winters). I even offered to fully support her if she moved with me.

But from her point of view, she thought I was set on going to Florida no matter what — that I was planning to ditch her. In reality, I was trying to get a remote position to stay with her. I assumed my actions made that clear. Instead of having an honest talk, she emotionally withdrew. She’s always struggled with communication, tending to suppress her feelings. Eventually, things fell apart, I moved to Florida, and the breakup was sudden and painful. She said she felt “peace” but also guilt.

Three months later, I find out she’s seeing someone new. That hurt — especially since she once told me she “wouldn’t be dating for a long time” if we broke up. But I respected it and started to move on.

Well… kind of.

I recently returned home to visit friends and had one wish: to see her again. The universe delivered. She reached out that she had something to return and agreed to meet up. I expected a quick handoff. Instead, we ended up talking for 2.5 hours — hand-holding, laughing, reminiscing, even crying. It felt like a date.

I played her a song (“New Way” by Ana Diaz — look it up). She gave me side-eyes, smiled, and said, “How’d you even find this?” I replied, “Late-night soul searching.” She stuck around to see a silly painting I made at a conference, laughed, and was genuinely engaged. Again — not something you'd do if you're happy and fully moved on with a new guy.

When I brought him up, she just said, “He’s a good man,” while tearing up. No joy. Just sadness.

I told her — confidently and respectfully — “I hope it works out… but I’m selfish and I hope he fumbles because I’d love another shot.” I said I’d give up my job, car, and everything to start again with her. She was clearly taken aback, even said, “That’s not the same guy I remember.” (It’s been 3 months since the breakup.)

I didn’t beg. I didn’t disrespect her or the new guy. I owned my past mistakes and told her she has the keys now — if she ever wants to come back, she just has to turn the ignition.

Since I didn’t have a car, she was nice enough to give me a ride to my friend’s place. Just her and I. No new guy. No friends. Just like old times. And it genuinely felt like a date with all the shared smiles and emotional energy.

So now I’m wondering:

- Did it feel like a date because there’s something still there?

- Will this make her second-guess her new situation?
Or was this just nostalgia and closure wrapped in  one long goodbye?

- Does any of this mean anything? Or am I just reading into it?


I’ve made peace with whatever happens. I’m building a new life in Florida and slowly moving forward. But truthfully… I still love her. And I think a small part of her still loves me too, even if she won’t admit it.

"I (32F) recently separated from an individual (33M) I fell hard for, and not speaking with him for some time has brought me revelations. . . It is frustrating and complicated.","I (32F) am hesitant to share because the nuances of being human, and the details and complexities of any relationship, are too intricate to squeeze into a post; however, I assume readers already take this into account.

This man (33M) was someone I had never experienced; the shared experiences we had are unforgettable. In the beginning, he was sweet toward me, attentive, and deeply present. I remember how regulated my nervous system felt, how my body vibrated or had a tingling sensation when being embraced by him, how there was a mutual ‘knowing’ that we were exactly where we needed to be, and how I can still become aroused by the way he smells. His long-term dreams and goals align with mine; I want to go where he sees himself going—somewhere quiet with lush land. Most of our morals and values also align. And I am not the person to raise my voice, call names, curse, or demean when having challenging conversations, and neither is he. There is so much more.

And there is now. We officially separated from one another 3 or 4 weeks ago after about 4 years of being together, with about 2 years of being on and off, to figure out how to resolve issues around compatibility, viewpoints, and other challenges since getting to know one another after some years have passed that I detail below.

This separation feels ‘official’ because all the other times felt incomplete, there were things to still try, and converse about. Now, there are no more words; it is just a happening, and it feels as though it is becoming a solidified end.

But this separation has brought up anger I have not felt before; I have been ruminating that I might have been an enabler, his emotional caretaker, from the beginning of our partnership.

From day one, I consistently tried to help him realize how wonderful and capable a man he was. The more I tried for him to see himself in the mirror I held up for him, the more he seemed to move in the opposite direction, or the less he seemed to believe in himself. I suppose the mirror I held up only reflected and emphasized the negativity he believed in himself, rather than what I wanted him to see. 

It seemed once we got over one hurdle, he hyper focused on the next issue or negativity that I painstakingly tried to shift his perspective on e.g., from him not feeling enough because I had certain kinks he was not ready to explore, believing most if not all people had cruel, ulterior motives or just sucked in general, to thinking what was the point of anything, if we are all going to die anyways.

I am indignant because I watched him slowly fall out of his passions and hobbies like photography, exploring places on his own, yoga, and camping. I watched him become disconnected, discouraged, critical, and depressed.

He is not interested in therapy because he said he already ‘knew’ what the therapists would say. His issue was putting into action what he already knew he had to do.

I detailed what I desired from him as a partner on multiple occasions after I noticed things began to fall away. What I thought was the bare minimum was too much and overwhelming for him. Maybe because our intimacy had to be crammed onto certain days instead of spreading it throughout, or maybe it was because he could not consistently regulate his nervous system to remain in the present moment. 

Regardless, his capacity seemed to be able to hold and think about his challenges. He seemed to always be in a process of figuring himself out, overthinking, and creating anxiety for himself out of everything, anything. I felt on occasions he could be there for me, but I was mostly there for him in the ways I knew how. Because when I asked what exactly it was he needed or desired from me, he could not tell me, he said maybe it was because I had already met all his needs and desires.

No matter how much we communicated or wrote to one another, it seemed to never ‘click.’ It seemed we could not put into practice what we continuously discussed, one of our most challenging patterns that we could not break. There seemed to be so much already stacked against us: our anger for our inability to make change toward betting our partnership, our inability to put our walls down and be ‘truly’ vulnerable. Or maybe I was patiently waiting for him to initiate change for once, without me having to encourage or pull it out of him.

It seemed he became afraid to love me after some trials and tribulations. Maybe he did not love me, but loved how I loved him. Maybe he could not love me because he did not know how to love himself.

I recently stumbled across his Reddit, where he writes openly, carefree, articulately, intellectually, expansively, and fearlessly. Yet, he was afraid to meet me where I am, where I wanted to be with him in love, vulnerability, curiosity, and playfulness. He seemed to have consistently met me with his articulateness and intellectuality, but where was his openness, carefreeness, expansiveness, and fearlessness? To have the comfort of being ‘seen’ through words on a screen, but discomfort to be seen wholly in person by me.

Now, I am questioning what I saw and believed in him; was it there to begin with, or did I just make it all up to convince myself of what I wanted him to be? Did I push him to see an idea of himself so much so that he fell into a depression? At this point, I am tired of speculating.

In hindsight, it was my mistake for wearing rose-colored glasses (something he often stated, that I wore rose-colored glasses), or rather, completely ignoring the blatant signs I was given, like the several conversations where he explicitly stated he did not believe he could be the man I wanted and needed. 

I am frustrated for being blind and holding on for so long. Maybe I am being too hard on myself. Maybe it was hope. The hope he gave me, stating that he would try. Maybe it was the hope of regaining what we originally felt: the intoxication of new relationship energy, the dream we believed we could build together.

I am doubting everything now, what we had. Was it just codependence? That seems too easy—to simply pathologize. We are human. I love a man who seems to need help, or maybe he does not need help at all, but simply, I hold too hopeful and positive a perspective on the world, and he does not, and that is okay. Maybe what we had in common after the heartache was not strong enough to hold a bond.

Maybe I am overthinking.

I do not think I can ever fully understand his perspective, pain, and challenges. I am just disheartened and upset that we could not figure out the blockages within our partnership and find a resolution. 

Of course, he has his perspective on me.

I just wish there was the capacity and ability to dig deeper with and into each other; he just seemed too afraid of himself and what we could have been.

Writing 'out loud,' if time is put between us, and we happen to come back together, what is it that we would need to do to stay committed? What am I missing? Is it possible to find resolutions in a partnership that allows it to feel wonderful and ‘easy’ again, regardless of what has happened?",1,2,2025-06-29 04:20:02,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln5tju/i_32f_recently_separated_from_an_individual_33m_i/,,,"My impression is that you spent the bulk of the relationship trying to change the guy. And while he was capable of making some incremental changes, he just was not able to change who he was at his core. And that core was not compatible with you."
Dating after heartbreak,"For those of you who have been through relationship trauma, how did you know you were ready to start dating again?

To make a long story short, my ex-fiance called off our wedding two weeks out nine months ago. It completely blindsided me. We tried to make it work again after the dust settled, and spent about 5 months in a weird limbo phase. We were basically together again but he was hesitant to label it. Whatever. I was very patient and offered a lot of grace (that he definitely didn’t deserve in hindsight), even after finding a few things that made me uncomfortable. He lost his job, I found something really devastating, and he started to pull away again. I think he felt so embarrassed and guilty for what he put me through that he spiraled into self-sabotage mode. He has a lot of rejection/abandonment issues and projected a lot of his insecurities onto me. I’m not claiming to be the perfect partner, but I know I didn’t deserve having the rug pulled out from under me and then being strung along for months while he tried to figure out his shit. Dude needs therapy, but whatever.

This has obviously been devastating. I know his actions have more to do with his own trauma than anything else, but obviously it’s hard not to take it all personally. I’ve done a lot of work in therapy, but it’s still really fucking hard navigating this kind of grief.

I can’t even fathom being ready to date again. The thought of getting back on the apps when you thought you’d never have to is depressing. At the same time, I’m in my late 30s and feel an overwhelming sense of missing out on so many major milestones. I’m mourning a future I never doubted. It’s a wild place to be mentally.

I don’t need anyone to tell me I’m not ready; I’m well aware. I’m just curious to hear about others’ experiences who have been in a similar situation. Was there a turning point for you?",2,4,2025-06-29 00:30:26,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln1ng1/dating_after_heartbreak/,,,"Honestly from my experience. I dated this woman in 2011 and we only dated for 6 months. She truly made me feel so loved and special that I thought she was the one. I ignored so many red flags because when you are in love you become blind to red flags. Turned out she never broke up with her boyfriend, he just gave her a hall pass. And she used me and scammed out of 3000 dollars. She got engaged in the Dominican Republic, and she never once said sorry or even cared how bogus she did me.   It took me a long time to finally let her go and move on. I fell into alcohol and drugs, that it affected my life. It was hard to get over someone I truly loved with all of my heart. I told myself I would never allow that to happen again and to protect my heart. I was single for over 5 years when she left me. Up until I met my other ex girlfriend. I met her on a dating app. And I thought maybe I need to stop letting my past trauma affect my future. I gave it another chance and I truly thought I went about things the right way and finally found the love of my life. 6 years down the drain I will never get back. To only be treated like a villain and not good enough for her. When I always loved her for who she was. She weaponized my mental health against me when I was always honest with her about it when we started dating.    The point to all of this.. it's when you think it's time and you feel you are ready then go try again. But my advice, don't do what most toxic people on social media say. Go to clubs, bars, random hook ups. I can speak form personal experience and friends .. all it does is put a temporary band aid. ||| OP I'm right there with you. I stayed nearly 3 years with a guy, being loving, caring, accepted him, and paid his rent when he was on disability from bad health yet he left a month ago.

I just turned 41 and I don't think I can handle dating for a while. ||| For another perspective, where I have some similar thoughts to you - I'm not ready right now. Don't know when I will be. I just don't put pressure on it for myself because if I rush it's less likely to succeed the next time around. There's no trust (with anyone, really) for me and healing is needed. When I'm not overthinking, analysing and struggling maybe I could venture back out. But not in ANY rush to do so. Hoping therapy will help and just having time out. ||| I'm scared to put myself back in to the dating world in fear that I will go through the same thing all over again"

Plan something every week to look forward to. Put it in your calendar or set it as a phone reminder. Invite friends or family. This is an obligation. Make plans. If your people bail last second; you still gotta go. 

New coffee shop you wanna try? Great. Don’t wanna spend money? Good thing there’s a park nearby to check out. Restaurants, ax throwing, movies, gym - you name it. Stay in and have a charcuterie night? That’s tight af. Don’t wanna leave your house? Maybe set up a game night to play something online with a buddy.

No closure? Here’s mine…,"We had a situationship that lasted about a month. It started on a hookup site but instantly became something more emotional. We clicked. Deep conversations, similar interests, constant texting, hours on the phone. It wasn’t love, but there was definitely a connection, and he said he felt it too. I was clear from the beginning. No expectations, just respect (I know Im in a point in my life where a relationship is a responsibility I can’t give myself 100% to, it would not be fair to either party). We even planned for me to travel to see him for a few days. We’d hook up and hang out. Casual, but emotionally honest. We told each other from the start we would be transparent, and that’s exactly what I did. I just ignored the fact that he was never transparent back. Now I know, a month is not enough time to truly form a connection with someone. The problem is that he never respected the connection that was forming.

Right as we were about to finalize the trip, he asked me, “If you came, would you end up hurt?” I told him the same thing I always had, no expectations, just don’t disrespect me. He said okay and we moved on. As an afterthought to a question he had I said, “The only reason I’d cancel the trip is if you weren’t 100% sure about meeting me or if you found someone else.” I said this because it’s completely true. Why would I want to go out of my way to travel to someone who doesn’t even want to see me? And why would I interfere with a real connection of his end if I knew I couldn’t offer the same? It was completely hypothetical, and it was mainly a point for him to understand that I cared about what he thought.

That’s when he turned weirdly defensive. He said, “You told me I could see other people, so I don’t get why you’re saying that.” I tried to explain he was free to explore anything with anyone, after all I would only have the right to ask for monogamy if I knew there was a possibility of a relationship. He didn’t want to hear it. He spiraled, said he wasn’t in a good place mentally, and bailed. I was understanding, even kind. I gave him options. Told him we can completely go no contact or try things out as only friends because I did value our conversations. He said he “didn’t know” what he wanted. So I left, respectfully, but I was furious. He ghosted, didn’t block me, just left it open. The whole conversation just made me realize he never valued my transparency. He tolerated it. And never gave any back.

So I wrote this. I haven’t sent it. Maybe I never will. But I need this off my chest….

“Here’s the truth, brutal and unfiltered. You weren’t some emotionally deep guy navigating hard feelings. You were a half-formed boy playing with something you weren’t built to hold. You initiated all of this. You pursued me. You said you felt the connection. You made plans. You pulled me in with attention and intimacy, and then flinched the second it required the tiniest shred of maturity. You disappeared behind a weak excuse and hoped I'd make the exit easy for you. You didn't even have the respect to finish what you started. You ghosted under the guise of being 'considerate.' No. You were just spineless.

You weren’t confused. You weren’t overwhelmed. You were never serious about anything other than yourself. You liked the way I made you feel, you just never intended to give anything back. You used me like an emotional mirror. And I see that now. I was honest. I was clear. I gave you more grace than you earned. And what did you give me? Silence. Avoidance. An unfinished conversation you didn’t even have the guts to close. You were never deep, you were just emotionally lazy. You don’t get to show up half-assed and leave with dignity. You don’t get to read my words and pretend they don’t apply to you. And you sure as hell don’t get to come back later when your loneliness finally catches up.

This isn’t heartbreak. This is clarity. And this is me cutting you off completely, mentally and emotionally. You're done. You are nothing more than a lesson I won’t need twice.”

I mean every word. I didn’t write this hoping one day he’d see this and change. I wrote it so I could walk away knowing I said what needed to be said to someone. Even if this catches the eye of one person, I know at least it’s out there.

Let this be a reminder to all you beautiful people out there, you can end something with dignity, even if the other person doesn’t. You’re allowed to be angry. You’re allowed to say it out loud :)",4,3,2025-06-28 19:33:35,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmvb2v/no_closure_heres_mine/,,,"being straightforward feels rough and best at the same time,what feels weird is when people in the start tend to feel like us, only to realise at the end that they are not us ||| Hey, I’m glad you have found some closure through that message.

29F 30M first vacation together and now i’m considering if we should break up,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for about a year and a half and have recently taken our first international trip together. The trip was nice, but I feel like it definitely showed where the cracks in our relationship were. We’re both very controlling people i’d say so I feel like we were butting heads a lot on small things when it came to that. I was also just getting annoyed every time he would tell me to do something, when I was already in the middle of doing it. We would just bicker about small things as well. Halfway through the trip I started to really get in my head, thinking that we need to break up. I can’t tell if this is a self sabotage thing I do because I’ve never really had a healthy relationship where you work with each other’s differences and compromise. No one’s perfect. But I guess I just don’t know if these small things are going to be alright in the long run, or if he just really isn’t the person for me. I love him so much and it kills me to think he might not be. But i guess i’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed by my emotions and don’t know how to look at them ",1,0,2025-06-29 03:02:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln4hco/29f_30m_first_vacation_together_and_now_im/,,,
What to do with the sadness?,"I see many people saying that they keep themselves busy and invest time into bettering themselves, but I can't seem to do that myself. I'm not the type of guy to go to clubs or parties or any large social events really. I just hangout with my small group of friends once or twice a week. When I'm surrounded by people I seem to almost forget that I'm sad. I do get random spikes of sadness every now and then, but I brush them off and keep going.

The real problem is when I'm alone. I am so demotivated and unenthusiastic to do anything. It feels like I have to force myself to do things, and when I do, they just feel like chores. Even if I somehow manage to do something to pass the time I'm just so unfocused that I end up stopping. When I'm alone the sadness creeps in and all these thoughts plague my mind. I just keep thinking about what could've been, and all that I did wrong. It has been so long since I've felt this lonely. My life is filled with long days and sleepless nights. 

How do you guys pass the time and keep your minds off the sadness when you don't have the motivation to do anything?",3,2,2025-06-28 21:01:49,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmxagk/what_to_do_with_the_sadness/,,,"you don’t wait for motivation   you build structure that carries you when your brain won’t  set a routine like your life depends on it   wake time, walk time, meals, sleep   non-negotiable   sadness thrives in chaos  then add 1 thing a day that takes 10 mins or less   read a page   do 20 pushups   clean 1 drawer   you’re not trying to win   you’re trying to *not sink*  and when the sadness hits? let it   you’re not broken for feeling it   you’re healing   but healing feels like shit before it feels like peace  [**NoFluffWisdom Newsletter**](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) has some no-BS takes on structure, emotional clarity, and crawling out of mental ruts worth a peek ||| I have been trying to be busy and/or better myself.

I Find Myself and a New Love Among Petals and Goodbyes,"Each breakup with him felt like a small death—not just of the bond we once shared, but of the idealized version of him I kept clinging to, even when there was nothing real left to hold on to. Every time he left, he did it with cruelty: indifferent, calculated, as if finding satisfaction in my pain gave him back the control he feared losing. He spoke words that hurt more than silence, leaving behind the echo of a broken promise and a shattered heart.

He played with my nostalgia like someone picking at an open wound. He knew how to return just when I felt most vulnerable, with empty gestures that looked like affection but were nothing more than an extension of his selfishness. Sometimes, I even found myself wishing he would come back—just to have something to rebuild. But without realizing it, each goodbye gave me something: more self-love, more strength, more clarity. Every breakup loosened his grip on me a little more, as if his image was being swept away by the winds of time.

And in the middle of all that pain, there was him… my friend, the florist.

We never planned anything. He was just as broken as I was, carrying his own story full of scars. But we talked, really talked. In his words, I found comfort. In his silences, peace. At first, it was just companionship—a mutual refuge. But something began to blossom, slowly and quietly, without either of us daring to name it. We were used to endings, so beginnings scared us. But every gesture, every afternoon spent among flowers and honest conversations, showed us that maybe we deserved something new—something gentle.

We’re not rushing. We don’t need to. All we know is that with each passing day, the memories and emotional attachments to our exes fade more and more—like spring mist dissolving between flower petals as the sun begins to rise. And where once there were open wounds, new roots are beginning to grow… something different, something real.

And this time, it doesn’t hurt.
This time, it blooms.

My first serious relationship ended abruptly because they weren’t ready for a relationship,"My gf (25 NB) and I (26 F)were long distance for about six months I flew out to meet them. The first two days were wonderful. We hit it off just like we did online. I had lunch with their dad. We shopped together and I cooked for them and their roommate. I helped them clean their depression room. 

The second evening, I initiated sex (which is something we’d talked about leading up to the visit). They said they weren’t ready or in the right headspace, then they began having an anxiety attack. I told them I would never make them do something they were uncomfortable with. They explained that past partners had pressured them. I cried because I was embarrassed and because I felt like I hurt them. I slept on the couch.

The next morning they didn’t sit next to me like they had before. We spent all day watching movies and it felt normal. That evening I asked if we were okay. They said they don’t know what they want. I asked if this was about sex or about our relationship. They said the latter. I asked if they were breaking up. They said they aren’t able to be in a relationship. I asked when they planned on telling me. They said they’d been trying to think of how to tell me all day. I left and went to a hotel for my last night before flying home.

This is my first heart break. I dated before, but never someone I liked this much. As someone on the spectrum, connections are hard for me. They understood me like no one else. I could tell them anything. We could just sit on a call in silence and be okay. I feel like I have whiplash. Before my trip I told all my friends and family about how excited I was. I had to come home with bad news. I feel humiliated, undesirable, and lonely. We have a lot of mutual friends online (we game together), and I don’t feel comfortable in those spaces anymore. They say they still want to be friends, but it’s not the same. I send them things that will make them laugh, and they reply. But that’s it. I used to talk to them every day. And now it’s over. 

I’m not angry at them anymore. I was at first for how abrupt it was, but they can’t help their trauma or their feelings. Now I’m just empty.

I cried for almost two days straight after the trip. I thought I was feeling better, but I ended up having a breakdown that could only be stopped with weed. Then another one a few days later that only stopped when I chugged alcohol. I had a panic attack at work this week. It’s been exactly two weeks, and I’m so lonely it hurts. I go to work, go out with friends, see family, and then I come back home and start crying again. I miss them so much. I miss that friend group. I just want to go back to normal.

Contact me when you move to town Long distance break up -,"Hey all! 

Gf broke up with me while we were still in the honeymoon phase. Was a long distance relationship because I travel for work and live in a different state. Our communication styles was the reason she cut ties. Working night shift and traveling ….I can get it and understand why she broke up with me.

It was truly heart breaking for and painful especially because I was falling for her. 

She said don’t contact me until November which is when I’m moving closer (for work) and it wouldn’t be long distance. 

She thinks no contact will help me heal but I don’t get it - reach out when you finally move here while I just remain heart broke for the next few months?

Just feels like she’s letting me sit here heart broken but willing to try again when we aren’t long distance.

Thoughts?

You probably want her to want you back but if she did this once she may do again if she hasn’t gone through some sort of personal growth or therapy. If there is accountability and she’s open about why she left you then maybe there’s a chance of repair. But other than that just assume this is checking to see if she can get back to the easy secure thing she left for the new exciting or possibility that was someone else. I’m which case you are just repeating the whole cycle again. If you can’t meet and hear her out but hold firm because you want her back then do yourself a favour and pass to save yourself the pain and time.   This is of course not knowing the nature of your relationship or break up. Main thing is that hell you just went thru, that’s the potential cost to pay if you let her back and she hurts you again and is it worth wagering that against reconciling and getting stronger together.   Hope the best for YOU either way man. ||| Your wound has healed, don't let it open again."

To him.,"My last act of love.

Now I finally understand what you want.
You want the freedom to be fully, unapologetically you.

And you know what? You’re right.

So I will stop holding space for the version of you that only existed in my hope.

I will accept you just as you are. I won’t try to change you into someone you are not.
I promise.

My last act of love is letting you be exactly who you are.

I will give you the freedom.
The freedom to seek validation from people who don’t even know your heart.

You won’t have to hear me beg for the bare minimum again. You won’t have to carry the weight of avoiding the pain you caused in the person you claimed to love so deeply, 
I promise.

You won’t need to gaslight and manipulate the person you claimed you want to share the rest of your life with, just to protect your pride.

You are free now.
Free from the presence of a woman who loved you with everything she had, and gave you the kind of love that you will never experience again. 

The freedom is yours now, to lie if you must, to run from accountability if that’s what feels safer, to seek attention and validation if that’s what feeds you. You are even free to protect your ego above all else.

You are finally free to be you.
But without me.

Long distance breakup (24F) and (23M),"Ive just gone through a long distance breakup myself, she initiated the breakup. Her (24F) and me (23M) were together for five years, long distance for 1.4 years, It hurts so much cause she was my first love and first everything. Honestly it was like a punch to the gut, I was in complete shock and couldn’t control myself, I did chase for a few weeks. She did say she still loved me and liked me. Said she needed space.

But after multiple failed attempts at getting any clarity or closure. I initially told her I would do NC, I’ve been NC for 1 month now and I regret asking if we could be friends ( I said it in the spur of the moment, scared to completely lose her ). At this moment in time, I wouldn’t be able to face her, if she had someone new in her life although i do want her to be happy.

I have conflicting thoughts/feelings. It’s so difficult not being able to talk to her anymore. I did feel her becoming more distant before it happened but didn’t say anything, I was honestly scared of losing her. And then boom, It felt like she was relieved that she didn’t have to initiate conversations with me. I started mostly all the convo’s before the breakup, I felt that she had already emotionally checked out beforehand she became quite cold. I had never seen this side of her. 

I’m very broken and would enjoy any advice on moving forward. I’m trying to find myself again. Yeah any suggestions.",1,0,2025-06-29 02:10:08,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln3jly/long_distance_breakup_24f_and_23m/,,1 month(s),

Please help me,"Honestly I am going to be super vulnerable rn. After the kissing incident (we had been broken up for a while) I started missing him because of how he kissed me and I reached out to him. He told me it meant nothing to him. 

I couldn’t stomach the answer and you don’t know how many times he blocked me and I found ways to reach out to him. He said he deserved better and realized now. 

I don’t know how much more I could have done. I loved that man so much even if people couldn’t tell. I gave him a place to stay in LA because he had no family and nowhere to go. He had a bad life in okc. He didn’t finished middle school let alone high school and my family helped him get his GED. I know he didn’t owe me anything because I helped him but I don’t know how much more I could show him that I loved him. 

Earlier this week after begging to see him. I contacted him through email and he agreed it went well but got awkward towards the end because I saw a message of him talking to his girl coworker. I freaked out and started crying and everything. But after I asked if he wanted to meet again that same day since he lived like 5 min away and he said he was home. I texted him and he left me on delivered so when I was going to go home. I saw him with that girl and I freaked out and I went up to them and asked him to help me. He did and called me weird and he called my mom and told on me. He told me she was his coworker. I was with him for four years through thick and thin. And I mean through everything. When he had no job when he lived in a trailer. 

I want so badly to text him and I want him back. I met him when I was 14 and he was 15-16. We are two years apart and we started dating when I was 15 and he was 17. I’m 19 now and I have spent every day since we met talking to him. He was my first everything. I know I made mistake and I miss him so much. Do you guys think there is any way I can get him back without him contacting my mom. He works at a restaurant in my uni. I miss him so much

"My relationship lost its sparked and being counted on to fix it, but im tired.","Hi, I’m 20(m) and partner 19(f) have been together for 6 months. What started as an exciting love story has been one of the most confusing and heartbreaking moments of my life. For the first 3 months I was my partner’s source of comfort, at the cost of my misery. She’d self sabotage to the point she’d get violent and almost hurt me in the process, a lot of lashing out, calling me names, etc. I fought for her and she did get better, but i ended up suffering in the process of her healing. 2 months before we were having problems and it involved my ex harassing me (mind you this was going on before I got with my current partner). Simply I did not want anything to do with her and it was obvious. My partner didn’t wanna believe me and it led to her texting another guy but ended up blocking him because she wanted to be with me after all
 ☠️. When I found out I was still heavy in my addiction, I was still in LALA land and thought she would never do anything like that to me. I left her but ended up taking her back because she begged and kept insisting things will be different, and well they did… at the cost of my self esteem. Though her behavior got better, she doesn’t stop talking about stories involving her ex’s, always referring to them as “someone i knew” and im not stupid so yeah anyways.. She started watching porn again at an insane amount. (BTW, yes I am a male that doesn’t agree with porn in a relationship. It ruined my relationships when I was younger and it makes your partner insecure, so yes it is a problem. If you have a different opinion, respectfully I’m not looking for your input on that aspect). Not just that she trips about me going out and having friends, even mocking some of my friends because they be calling me and asking me to hangout LOL. Like how is it “gay” for a friend to call you have conversations with you? Honestly I never got this because she’s the type of person to have no irl friends, but has an online best friend she calls and its a dude thats way older than both of us 😭.. god forbid if i call another girl while my girlfriends sleeping. Like how can you watch porn but I cant go to rave or go out with my homies to somewhere where people are around.

My girlfriend (21F) broke up with me (24M) After she failed to pass her 2nd year of university.,"i've been seeing my current girlfriend for a good 6-7 months. The last couple of months i've received love and acceptance in a way that i've never experienced before. I was treated poorly in the past and this finally felt like the relationship i've always wanted. We attend the same university, and for the last 2 semesters i've been cruising with high grades with little to no effort. My girlfriend on the other hand struggled a lot, her grades were in free fall and with every semester results she shuts down and goes into some sort of psychosis (idk if i can call it that but deep detachment from life and herself). The end of year results came around and i did so well that i got sent on a university trip for top students, while she was retaking exams.
All of this being said, i couldn't care less about all of this, I'm stating this only for context. Every single exam period i've tried reassuring her, my only focus was her passing semester i would put my revision on hold just to be able to help her study. I've done everything in my power so she could pass the year, literally everything i can do just to help her feel okay. I've even reassured her that i've failed 4 years in a row and I'm okay and still pushing. No matter what i said or how much i reassured this was life or death for her. 5 days before the results of her exams we've run into issues in our relationship, she was being overly aggressive cold and on edge.

All of a sudden she felt like it was too much, that the academic failure she was living was the main issue. She broke it off with me then and there saying that she wants to rebuild her social circle because she's been led astray and that caused her academic failure.
My mind couldn't compute this and i decided to accept it. After three days i was still in shock and denial, so i called her and we got
""back together"" but she had one foot out the door and i knew it but still decided to stay because i've never been so sure that someone loved me ever. Fast forward to yesterday where it got confirmed that she's repeating the year, she just sends me a texts
""Our break will still keep going and i think there's no going back"".
I'm genuinely confused. This is someone who i know 100% is deeply in love with me, but when this thing came around it's like i was this barrier or burden i don't know what to even call it. I'm not minimizing her issues, this is a big deal for her and i want to be there for her. I just don't get how leaving me solves anything. I'm being so genuine when i say i tried everything to help her. I can't bring up my concerns or emotional state because it's selfish as she's going through a lot. i still want to be with her, i've learnt when to let go of relationships. I was single for a long time before her, but this just feels so random and weird all at the same time.

What do i do?",1,0,2025-06-29 01:40:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln301u/my_girlfriend_21f_broke_up_with_me_24m_after_she/,,,
"She broke up with me in March , still having a hard time.. an I wrong for feeling this way?","

Hey everyone, I’ve been quietly following r/breakups for a while, and now I need to get this off my chest. I’ve been reflecting on texts from March to April with my ex, and it’s been a gut punch of emotions that’s left me questioning my actions. I’m here to sort it out and hear your perspective did I push things too far, or was this breakup just inevitable? It started in early March when she lost sleep worrying about me being sick, a sign we still had some connection. By March, she sent a quick “I love you,” but it felt more like a habit than deep feeling, maybe because she was already worn out. Mid March got tense when she said she missed me, but I couldn’t find the words to reply, and that silence hurt us both. Then, she needed time to process a video I sent that clearly broke her heart, and I didn’t know how to fix it. She tried a playful “who dis?” with a new number, hoping to lighten things, but it just showed how distant we’d become. March was a mess when she lashed out saying she’d found someone else to make her happy, though later she admitted it was a lie to push me away because she was exhausted and couldn’t keep me happy. She demanded space, warning we were done if I didn’t give it I felt lost but backed off. Late March, she tried to hold on; she felt for my cousin’s loss, and suggested family photos, but a missing package had her doubting me.

April just got heavier. She was furious I blocked her after she sent desperate, humiliating texts, and I felt cornered by her intensity. She accused me of messing with her mind, mentioning a voicemail I ignored, and the gap between us widened. April was rough when she tried to calm things, saying she didn’t want fights or threats, but admitted I’d pushed her to a breaking point where she almost gave up. She was mad I sent stuff through strangers instead of facing her, and I didn’t know how to respond. She wouldn’t let it go, and by April mentioned an appointment maybe therapy to deal with trust issues and threats, leaving me feeling like I’d failed her. The end hit hard in late April. She told me she’d ignored her therapist’s advice because she loved me so much, just wanting to hold me and see if I was real she even said she didn’t care if I was with someone else, just don’t tell her, and suggested I get tested. She said “I love you goodnight,” warned me she looked rough from months of being sick, and asked for honesty, giving it one last shot. She asked if I worked, clinging to normalcy. Then she broke down and admitted she’d slept with someone else after we split, apologized, and said I could block her if I wanted I was stunned. I lost it, calling her crazy and telling her never to contact me again, while she just said she was disappointed, and that was it.

Then came May, and I did something I can’t undo. I crossed a line I was furious, humiliated, and heartbroken, pushed past what I could handle, and I lashed out. I wasn’t thinking about right or wrong; I just wanted her to feel a piece of the pain she’d dumped on me. I wanted her exposed, embarrassed, and powerless, because that’s how she left me tossed out, blamed, silenced, and erased. She walked away spotless, twisting the story her way while I was left in the rubble, dazed and hurt. But now I see it: that moment wasn’t strength it was pain I couldn’t carry, turning me into someone I don’t recognize. I’m not proud of it, but I won’t hate myself for being human and hurting. I don’t owe her forgiveness, contact, or peace, but I owe myself a fresh start. I owe myself the power to stop letting her drag me back into her drama. I don’t need to fight for the truth anymore I just need to live it. What happened was raw, but it wasn’t pointless; it came from betrayal, abandonment, and manipulation, and I reacted. That side of me doesn’t need to be buried it needs to be understood. Now that I’ve faced it, I know I won’t lose myself like that again. She doesn’t get to define me by my worst day I do. And this is where I leave her behind, not for revenge or closure, but for my own peace.

Looking back, it started with love but crashed with that video in mid March. I struggled to hold on, but the trust was gone, and her health struggles by April made it worse. Her confession about the other person and my May outburst felt like the final blows did I push too hard, or was it already over? It’s been over two months now, and I’m still wrestling with it. Was I wrong to shut her out, react the way I did, or let it end like that? I’d really appreciate any advice or stories from you all thanks for being here.

is it normal to move on in 9 months,"i broke up with my boyfriend of nearly 4 years in september because i didn’t feel ready to get married (and he wanted to) and as a result started to doubt parts of the relationship. we’re from different cultures and that was one thing i started to have an issue with. the problem is is that i loved him so so so much like he is genuinely the love of my life but i knew i wasn’t making him happy because i wasn’t giving my 100% and i knew i wasn’t in the right head space. he is genuinely everything and is so perfect and is the best person to be in a relationship with and we got on so well and he loved me so much. 
fast forwarded to now, it had been nearly 9 months and ive changed a lot. i’m ready to get married and i know that he’s the one i want to be with, i really haven’t moved on at all. 
i hand-wrote him a 25 page letter explaining how i felt and delivered it to his house. the letter took hours and hours as you can imagine. i genuinely love him with my whole heart and i feel that i have made a massive mistake and i want to be married to him. 
he responded and said that he doesn’t have feelings fr me anymore, and he doesn’t think he ever could again. he said even if he wanted to his family wouldn’t allow him to. he said he’s changed and that this is no longer what he wants because he felt like he wasn’t treated right. 
i am so so devastated and depressed. i’ve genuinely felt the lowest i’ve ever felt in my life, more than when it first ended. the reason is because i can see so clearly how happy we could be together and how much ive changed for him but he doesn’t want that anymore. it’s so hard when you love someone this much and they don’t want anything to do with you. also, because i was the problem before, he had so many things probably to help him to move on but because he was genuinely perfect i can’t think of a single negative thing to help me move on. all i can think is how sad i am and how low i feel. i genuinely have no energy to do anything and all i think about or want to talk about is this. i just don’t know what to do and i really don’t feel like im going to get better. how can i get better knowing that i ruined my chance at happiness? knowing that i let the love of my life go? knowing that everything was my fault?
it makes me sad also because i don’t understand how he can be so moved on in less than 9 months when our connection and love was so deep? is that normal?
please, i need advice, how can i move on as he has?

Tbh, you say these amazing things about him, but you still broke up with him. And when you broke up with him, you knew the risks associated with it. And if I'm honest, that break up probably decimated him too because he wanted to build a future with you.  It's better for you to move on now - he had too.   But the bright side is, there's so much opportunity out there that you are completely unaware of. Focus on healing and moving on, you'll find someone that is better for you I promise! ||| Without knowing the full situation and dynamics of the relationship, I will say that when you feel you want to break up with someone it is normally due to genuine feelings of being unsure or seeing the incompatibilities/problems. Of course people can be avoidant or scared and back away too.   Within the time of being broken up, sometimes our brains forget the full weight and feelings of how we felt in those moments - the red flags we may have seen, what was worrying us or making us feel that it wasn't the right decision to be together. Then the silence or lack of regular contact with your ex can mean that you may fill in the blanks and view things in a much more positive regard.  I'm sorry to hear that they're not feeling the same as you right now. That's so hard to hear. But I wonder whether you would truly want it, if you had it back again, and it felt similar to how things were before? You broke up with them, so I would assume this was with enough reason and feeling at the time.  Maybe there's someone out there who won't make you feel so much that way. And if it is just that the timing for both of you was off, in terms of what you both wanted, I guess it still leads to the fact that they have different directions they want to go in now, and it doesn't seem to include you. So anything further than this would be seemingly more one sided and you wouldn't get that vision that you have in your mind of a long term working relationship together. But (when you're ready, of course!) maybe that will happen with another person later down the road, and maybe it'll cause you to think back and be grateful that it never worked with anyone else.  Regardless of how it works out for you or how accurate or not I have been here, I hope you are ok because break ups and uncertainty is so tough and there is a community here that you can lean into. 🤍"
"Got back with ex, found out he has been dating a new girl the whole time","I was in a serious relationship with my boyfriend for 7 years, it was amazing at the beginning he was so romantic and it really felt like a fairytale even though we were very different people. Over time he started to become very complacent, and could be very cold and cruel at times, was shady with his phone and instagram, would never commit to marriage and was generally very argumentative, so my love for him faded because of this. After a huge argument we had because he cancelled last minute on our anniversary dinner (due to a night of heavy drinking the day before) I broke up with him. This was in December.

He wanted to get back together almost immediately and would spam me with calls and texts, letters and flowers, but I just felt like there was no way we could make it work. Eventually, he got through to me and convinced me that he had been going to therapy, working on himself, and that he had truly changed and would be better boyfriend and wanted marriage etc. so we started talking and eventually going out on dates and even sleeping together again as the love and spark came back - but every time I asked when we should tell people we were back together, for some reason he then hesitated and made up excuses.

We had started talking pretty much every day and seeing each other weekly in February. Now it is June, and I was starting to feel so happy and excited for a new and improved relationship with someone who I cared so so much for… and then I hear he has been dating someone for months, introducing her to his friends, had each other’s location on their phones, and as of yesterday was still dating her, according to my friend who is close to the new girl’s best friend, (a girl that is dating my ex’s best friend.) I feel so sick and betrayed, and so exceptionally stupid. I knew what he was like but I still went along with it. I really wanted to believe it could be like it was in the beginning, I feel so devastated.

I don’t want to put the person who told me this in an awkward position at all so I just decided to block him on everything without a word. When he knew I was meeting this girl asked me to please not mention him at all. We were chatting normally and sending cute messages this morning, and now he is blocked on everything and using his dad’s phone to call me constantly. I don’t know what to do, he is incredibly good at convincing me that he has done nothing wrong - very very very good, he has done it many times. And clearly an exceptional liar as he has been seeing me, her, and god knows who else since we broke up. Now I think he may have been lying about therapy too. 

Do I respond to him or talk to him about it? Am I being unreasonable to just totally ghost him because of this? He is still calling me on his dad’s phone as I type this, over and over again. Could use opinions, as I am spiralling.

He doesn't deserve your energy. Honestly he would probably get off on the idea of you being angry or upset -- because that's a sign that he can control your emotions.

Genuinely need some help :( I am going crazy,"It’s been almost 2 months since we broke up. I was the one who ended it — not because I stopped loving her, but because I felt emotionally drained and unseen. My needs weren’t being met. She was inconsistent, avoided emotional closeness, and I constantly felt uncertain about where we stood. I used to be patient, calm, and grounded — but over time I became reactive and emotionally anxious because I felt like I was the only one fighting for the relationship.

We were long-distance, but I showed up — planned trips, made time, put effort into thoughtful gestures. We shared intimacy that felt deep to me — emotionally and physically. But behind the surface, there was always a layer of emotional distance from her that I could never quite get through.

Early in the relationship, I found out she was still talking to her ex — something she never disclosed, and something I stumbled on by accident. I even discovered she still had intimate videos from that past relationship, which broke my heart. That, combined with her texting another guy and trying to go on a date after we became exclusive, really shattered the trust. She claimed she didn’t follow through, but it didn’t matter — I felt betrayed. I forgave her, but I couldn’t forget.

After I forgave her and she asked me to ask her to be my girlfriend, she looked genuinely happy. For a while, it felt like she really loved me deeply. She took me to meet all her close friends, took me to meet her family, stayed with them many times, went out to dinner with them etc. When i was with her at her place i used to check her iPad because of trust issues (i know i was wrong her) and she found out and that broke her trust as well we communicated and she forgave me. The main issue was every month, she would emotionally distance herself for 7–10 days — completely shut down, become cold, and unreachable. It wrecked me every time. I’d express how it made me feel, how it reopened my fears, and begged her not to pull away again.. But that cycle repeated — and asking her every time not to disappear drained her too. We were both emotionally exhausted, trying to keep something alive while we bled out.

After the breakup, I blocked her from everything except TikTok.  The next day, she texted me there saying she “wanted to talk,” but didn’t open up when I called (same old avoidance and pulling away). Then she went back to talking to old flings — within one week. The next week i travelled to her city for work and she found out i was there through mutuals and she texted me “i miss you being here, cant change it, just saying and asked me if we could grab coffee but i didn’t agree to it because it took her one week to reach out to old fling. A month later, she was back on dating apps and even followed the same guy who had caused the original trust issues when we were exclusive. That was the final punch but it made me laugh because that guy didn’t follow her back and that she is trying to fill the void with anyone and everyone. 

The last few days have been brutal. I thought I was doing okay, but I stumbled on our backed-up photos in Google — videos of her calling me “baby,” of her smiling, laughing in bed, cooking together, going on hikes. Everything came flooding back. And while I’m crying in bed, she’s recently started posting TikTok videos and she looks happy, looking like nothing happened.

We had real moments. I helped her process trauma. I held space for her. I was patient, loving, and gave her all of me. But it felt like she couldn’t give me the same in return — or wouldn’t. And now, she’s moved on like I was just a pitstop in her story. I’m not even angry at her anymore — I just feel disposable.

Has anyone else experienced this kind of delayed grief, even when you were the one who ended it? I still love her, but I know I couldn’t stay in a relationship where I didn’t feel emotionally safe. I’m trying to move on, but the weight of it all still sits heavy on my chest.",1,0,2025-06-29 00:39:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln1tr5/genuinely_need_some_help_i_am_going_crazy/,,,
Losing appetite post breakup,"So I have totally lost my appetite after my breakup. I'm only taking in about 1/2 - 3/4 of what I need to be eating. I usually exercise quite a lot but because of my drop in hunger I'm worried to work out as it's just burning fuel that I don't have. 

Tried eating smaller portions but I can't even look at calories rich foods right now. 

Side note: it's only been 4 days since the break up so I know I'm probably being quite harsh on myself. Been a while since my last breakup so I have sorted of forgotten how this all works!

"It's been two years and I'm still picking up the pieces,","Me and my ex girlfriend started dating three years ago, it was just kinda like, a depressing day for me honestly, I was very withdrawn mentally I just got out of a horribly abusive relationship with my ex a few months prior, (sexually cohersive pathetic looser) it was algebra class back in highschool, I had noticed her before... The cute emo kid in the back of class, always made me blush from the start, one day she just... Sat next to me, I didn't really think much of it but oh boy was I blushing internally, she said I just looked ""interesting"" I did notice however that she was shaking really badly, apparently later she said she was about to have a panic attack, I don't remember exactly why, but months later she never really came to school, one day tho she tried to approach me chickened out came back around chickened out again and I guess we started talking from there? I fell in love quickly and so did she honestly I don't remember somewhere along the line *I* had a panic attack and suddenly we understood eachother so well she felt like she finnaly wasn't alone and so did I, but the thing was this was the first time I ever felt real love, every other time I was being manipulated by some sleez bag, i actually felt love, real love, and it changed everything, it was such a contrast to my shitty life I could tell more stories but honestly I guess I couldn't but I loved her so so so deeply, but the truth Is? She never really loved me, I don't think she did... She just wanted an insurance policy, she wanted intimacy in person because she only has an online relationship for years, she felt like she was obligated to save the world, she pittied me, she wanted me to feel special and loved and... Well she did. She would always talk about how she wanted someone to just love her for who she was... But I did.... Someone who wouldn't leave.... I didn't... But I guess at some point she realized she was better off without me, she even said that out loud, she realized she deserved people who didn't stress her out (I couldn't help my life was shambles and I was fighting desperately to glue it together) she deserved someone attractive someone she *wanted* and she didn't owe anyone commitment, I guess I'm happy for her but in reality? I'm not. I wish she never knew. I always said I wanted her to finnaly develop a sense of self worth i even said things that only hurt her relationship with me sacrificing myself for what I thought would be her better future that if I did that it would show I was worth keeping. It didn't. The opposite infact. All it did was show her she deserved better... If I had known I would never meet someone like her again if I had known I'd never deserve a second chance. That I'd be alone and heartbroken for years. I would have chosen to be selfish. It would have been the only way. Am I fucked up? Kinda yeah. But someone like me will never deserve someone like her. The only way I can ever have anyone is if they believe the aren't good enough for anyone else. If they believe they have to settle for me. The more this happens the more and more I just wanna be selfish. I'll never have my slice of life if I'm not. This world wasn't built for people like me. and I care less anyways. The make people that discard me like trash? That I have to go ""I understand"" to that i have to be afraid of live in fear of constantly excusing everything about myself. Maybe I don't care. Maybe I'm tired of caring? Will I...? Yeah- it's just in my nature. At my very core it's not gonna go away, but I'm still changing a quiet fury is building up inside me, a quiet bitterness... a quiet rebellion, a silent protest to the world. If I'm trash, if I'm subhuman so are you. And I'll treat you like it.",1,0,2025-06-29 00:33:56,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln1pvj/its_been_two_years_and_im_still_picking_up_the/,,,
Really struggling with losing someone who meant the world to me,"My (25M) girlfriend (23F) ended things with me abruptly on a Wednesday night right as I got home from work. It was a shock and both of us were crying. I didn’t understand at all as we had a great couple of nights prior. This was a month ago. We went no contact and I did well for about an eight days. Then I couldn’t handle being away from her anymore. It was like how people say their grandparents act different when they’re away from their partner. I just felt so alone and missed the laughter and care we had for one another. I know breaking no-contact was a mistake. I’ve struggled with controlling my sadness and often times feel this need to hold on tight. I ask and ask for conversation so we can talk things through. It wasn’t pretty. I was full of tears. She made it very clear I have things I need to see to. I have really bad addictions to my phone and video games. I’ve since removed video games from my life and have spent an average of three hours a day on my phone versus an average of EIGHT! I’ve also gone to therapy and am seeing a life coach to help me find a career more in line with what matters to me. I’ve supplemented that by volunteering at my church’s soup kitchen which has been really calming. I’ve committed to making these changes for myself because I know I needed to change. However, I also wanted to show this effort to her. Fast forward a week or so, she’s in town. She lets me know and asks to meet up. Instantly I am all ears. It went so well. I had an absolute blast and I really get that our spark was still there. I then maybe made the mistake of asking her if we could squeeze in more time Sunday. “Sure” but she was quick to remind me that she still needs space after her visit. I was so excited to tell her about my new habits and routine, but this time she seemed cold and more distant. I know I was always rough around the edges, but I always gave her my all. As we said goodbye, it felt final, and I said that… she said maybe she’ll reach out in a month or so when my emotions have settled… I was gutted because it felt done… I wanted to change because I know I could be better, and I wanted to show her that I was doing this because she is important to me. I just feel alone and broken.",1,0,2025-06-29 00:29:52,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln1n28/really_struggling_with_losing_someone_who_meant/,,,

My ex contacted me - Spoiler - he's still the same,"Yep. I'm here to give all of us who's still holding onto the hope that our ex will change, will come back to our lives and beg for us and want us, a reality check, but you know what?

 My ex of 5 years did exactly that 6 days ago and we spent 4 days together and you know what? Despite what everyone wants, ""*I want him to apologize and come back and love me again,""* he came back worse. He still never took responsibility for his cheating. He still never responsibility for his toxicity and abuse. 

So for all of us hoping for our ex to contact us, you're better off just living a life for yourself. Nobody else, just yourself and just focus on just yourself. Not him, not her, not anyone, JUST yourself, because NO ONE, I mean no one, will love you more than you love yourself. 

Take it from someone who's a hopeless romantic, who wants nothing more than to be settled down with a family. It's not worth chasing after your ex who isn't chasing after you.

How do I move on if we have to stay in contact about the lease? She says I can’t block her and I don’t even know if I have the guts to do that.

"It starts hurting more after a month, we still have contact. I feel much worse after my family found out about the breakup.","Hi, I guess it's gonna be vent. So a month ago my ex broke up with me, random monday, I didn't feel like we had any problems, I thought we were both fully interested in continuing the relationship. Our breakup was pretty calm and mature. I thought we were ending contact completely, but he convinced me that we could still be best friends. I honestly liked this option. The first two days were awful, but after that I started to feel okay. I have a feeling it was only because I convinced myself we would get back together. There are moments when our conversations seem more like flirting or something more, which was also quite confusing and still is, especially since we have both said many times that a friends with benefits is not for us. Now, after a month, it's starting to dawn on me that maybe we won't get back together this time. I feel like lying down and crying again.


Today he texted me that his friends were asking so much about me, that he had to tell them that we broke up, and that they were quite shocked and curious why. This also definitely broke me because, if he told them, it is already a certain decision. But I was also surprised that it was only now that he told them, considering that they have contact with each other every day. And honestly I feel like his family still doesn't know, so his mom probably thinks I'm going camping with them in August.


Now I'm at a family reunion for a week where everyone knows we were together, most of them have met him so the news of our breakup spread quickly. Literally as a greeting I got ""there are still plenty of fish in the sea"" instead of hey. And now I have the impression that this is the main topic towards me. So now I'm getting advice from everyone that I need to find someone new, or better yet, start sleeping with as many men as possible and choose the best one. That if I find someone and we get married it will probably end in divorce, but then I will find that true love.


And of course there was talk that since my ex is man in his mid 20's he must have cheated on me. I know he didn't do that, I know him and over the years we've never had any issues with infidelity, and it definitely wasn't the reason we broke up. Which doesn't change the fact that it somehow hits me every time, and it makes me start to overthink, and it makes me irritated. I just wish someone would just say that it will be okay whether we get back together or not, instead of treating this as the perfect time to push me into clubs or tell me about their theories.",1,1,2025-06-29 00:17:43,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ln1end/it_starts_hurting_more_after_a_month_we_still/,,,"Don't worry, a lot of people experience exactly what you are going through. Some people aren't unfortunately emotionally mature enough to understand how to be compassionate to somebody who is experiencing grief. They think it is just sadness so will say things that they believe will cheer us up or make us angry at the other person, however it is a deeply biological response that unfortunately for us simply takes time and healthy habits to heal.   Don't be afraid to ask people to speak with a little more compassion, if they love you they will understand.   Now, for the cheating comment. I am right there with you. My 26(F) partner broke up with me out of the blue and with absolutely no warning. One day we where happy, the strongest couple anybody know, the next she left me. I have had a lot of people asking if there was another person and I truly do not believe there was. We loved together, spent all out time together, and at the end of the day whilst I am hurt we have broken up she was far to good of a person to do that to me. To the people who ask the question, and great them with that response and they instantly understand. It's difficult but we have to try not to lash out when our emotions are heightened like this. People are very rarely trying to hurt us, they simply aren't thinking.   Hope this helps and stay strong!"
"i cant stop thinking about my girl. i broke her heart, and now she broke mine.","im sorry for all the grammar errors I just feel so raw and heartbroken and empty and despairful ane grieving. her crying is etched into my memories, and I feel so awful for provoking it.

i jsut broke up with her. the feelings are so raw and emotional. she was codependent snd that was the crux of the issue. i just wrote a long thing here and i lost it. it froze on me. i wrote her a final message hours ago telling her how much i loved her and how much this affected me because she thought it didnt affect me. no snuggles, no kisses, no vacation like we were supposed to have. just emptiness.

and i see her location. and like it being there. i like seeing her contact in my phone even though it hurts.

i just feel so numb after sobbing. her last texts were begging me to give her another chance but i didnt budge. and i sent her this.

it hurts to even see your face in my contacts, and I’ve been sobbing. I just want you to know that I did care about doing tbis and feel like it was right for both of us but really want the absolute best for you in life. This was far from easy and I feel so much hurt inside.

I feel horrible about this but hope you can find someone who really makes you happy, as sad as that makes me to say.

Love zach

I feel so sad and so numb, like a hole in my chest thats filled with good memories. We had a great relationship besides the recent arguments. She didn’t want me to see my family, wanted ne back at certain times, wanted me to run everything by her in terms of future hangouts with frienfs or family and if I came home slightly late shed be secretly stewing. so i couldn’t love her how she wanted me too. and she couldn’t love me how i wanted her to - with breaks of independence.

it was toxic but also loving and fantastic at times. im starting my new job at a great company in two days but it’s overshadowed by this. i just feel awful, and don’t know what to do. almost feel willing to text hef again, and want her to text me so bad for some reason, just for her to show me she still loves me like i love her. i dont know how to go on, because aI knew the relationship wasn’t gonna work, but don’t want it to end, but it already has. her removimg my name from the ig bio stung like hell, as it seemed like she went from sobbing and begging for me to stamping me out.

but she didnt block me, and i didnt block her, and maybe thaat connection — and my location that she can see, and her location that i can see — is what we need to get through this.

she told me she would change to what i wanted but i felt wrong about that. zhe wouldnt be happy and eventually it would change. ahe was desperate but now i feel like her.

My boyfriend 20M and I 21F He becomes emotionally distant when stressed — is this normal or are we slowly falling apart?,"
My boyfriend 20M and I 21F 
It's been 1.5 years together ,and we were like the happiest couples . 
Recently, he’s been under a lot of stress due to college admissions, and I completely understand that. But when he gets stressed, it feels like I disappear from his life...
Whenever I try to talk about our relationship or how I’m feeling, he tells me he's “trying,” but I don’t really see any changes in his actions. A few days ago, even after repeatedly telling him I was hungry, he forgot entirely. We’ve had a few small arguments recently, which we’ve talked through, but overall, I feel like we’re drifting.

One thing that really got to me: he used to say “good night” every night, without fail. It was a small gesture that made me feel remembered. Now, he doesn’t, and that change triggered my panic attacks again. I told him how I felt last night — he apologized a lot and stayed up texting me till 3 AM. But tonight, it’s the same — no message, no check-in.

I know sleep isn’t fully in our control, and I don't want to nitpick, but even when I’ve cried next to him, he doesn’t wake up or comfort me. He’s also been skipping meals and feeling physically drained. When I try to explain how his emotional absence is affecting me, he just tells me how hard things are for him, and I end up feeling guilty for even bringing it up.

I’m not asking for fancy dates or big gestures — I just want the emotional bare minimum. But lately, even that feels like too much to ask. I’ve noticed he only really responds if I flirt heavily or say something extreme, which makes me feel awful.

I don’t think he’s cheating — he’s not that kind of person — but I honestly don’t know if he still loves me. He doesn’t laugh at my jokes anymore, even the silly ones he used to love. His expressions have changed. It’s like he doesn’t hate me, but it feels like he doesn’t see me either.

I’ve never expected much, and I’ve given my all to this relationship. But now, I’m left feeling like I’m annoying or burdensome for even asking for attention. I’m genuinely confused — is this just a rough patch, or am I holding on to something that’s already ending?

Would really appreciate some outside perspective.",2,11,2025-06-28 20:22:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmwer7/my_boyfriend_20m_and_i_21f_he_becomes_emotionally/,,,"Your boyfriend is a classic avoidant personality type, if he doesn't change this behavior lose him before you lose yourself trying to stop the relationship from breaking, trust me I learned it the hard way.

"She left, I’m trying to understand what really happened and whether I should cut all contact","I’m really struggling to make sense of a breakup and I’d really appreciate some outside perspectives.

I (32M) was in a relationship with a colleague (35F) for more than a year. It was intense and meaningful — we connected deeply, and early on she talked about me moving in with her and her children. I said I prefered to take things slowly about that. 
Sometimes she pressured me a lot and didn’t let me space. She wanted to spend every minutes together even when we’re seeing each other already at work.
Our relationship wasn’t known at work, only by our friends and family, because the Director was against this kind of things.
I admit I became distant at times. I didn’t step up when I should have. 
But I was always careful, making her surprises and to her children too, driving 30mn to her place at 3am when she called me just because she didn’t feel good etc 
I spent time with her and her children, taking them to a resort park, to the boy’s birthday…
Only 3 days before we broke up she was still sending me cute messages and hugging me all the time.

Recently, she started growing close to the Director who just became single. I had suspicions something was happening — there were signs — but she never admitted to anything directly. She just told me that she indeed tried something with him because he gave her feelings that the door was open and that she was feeling lonely and I made her wait for too long to committing, move with her and her children (6 and 12 yo) and everything. That she cried too much because of me and don’t believe in us.

But she’s still sending mixed signals:
	•	She didn’t take back all of her stuff or her keys.
	•	Her WhatsApp photo is still one she took for me in my bed.
	•	She recently messaged me: “It felt good to talk to you.”

I asked her to tell me clearly if I didn’t miss her and if she really don’t want to live with me anymore. But she said « you know I can’t say that ». She says she has still feelings for me but don’t want to keep fighting for the relationship and she won’t come back.

I told her I still loved her. I said if she ever wanted to try again, I’d be there. But she hasn’t even opened that last message — it’s been over a day.

I’m spiraling. I imagine them together all the time. And my instinct scream that it’s already the case. I can’t sleep. I can’t eat. I feel lost.

I don’t know if I have enough strength to go to work and being with them two. We have several meetings per week and I’m pretty sure that, even if they see each other, she didn’t tell him about me.

So here I am wondering:
	•	Should I go no contact even after telling her the door was open?
	•	Was she ever fully honest with me? Or was the breakup already planned so she could be free to explore something with someone else?
	•	Am I just prolonging my pain by clinging to the past?

I don’t know what to do. I feel devastated. I surprised myself watching by the 6th floor window for a jump.

I know I wasn’t perfect, I know I should have been more here for her sometimes. But does that justify this? It’s like I was nothing to her even if she always told me she loved me, that she would give me a child and spend the rest of her life with me.

What I know now (still hurts though),"I didn’t realize we were coming at this relationship from completely different places. I was trying to build something real, something that could survive arguments, miscommunication, hard days. I thought if I was patient, if I explained myself, if I showed her I cared, it would matter. But she wasn’t operating from that same mindset. I was trying to fix. She was trying to maintain control. That mismatch alone made everything harder than it had to be.
I didn’t fully understand how our emotional wiring clashed. I tend to lean in when things get tense. I try to talk it through, understand, make sense of it. She pulled away, lashed out, or blamed. The more I tried to hold things together, the more it seemed to push her further away. I didn’t realize I was caught in a loop. Me chasing connection. Her pulling back or flipping the story. And neither of us could break it.
I also kept assuming her messages meant the same things mine did. When she was upset, I took it as an opening. A chance to clear things up. But most of the time, she wasn’t trying to work through anything. She just needed someone to take the hit. I kept walking into those moments thinking we were going to figure things out, but I was just giving her more chances to unload and then blame me for the fallout.I carried too much of the emotional weight. I took responsibility for things I didn’t even fully understand, because I thought it would help. I tried to own my part, even when it wasn’t all mine to carry. And she let me. She dumped her pain on me and called it honesty. I was trying to meet in the middle. She was handing me all the blame and stepping back.What I didn’t see was how much of this was about control. Not love. Not connection. She needed to feel like she was the one calling the shots, and I needed to feel like we were both trying. That difference. That fundamental split. Is what kept us stuck. I wasn’t wrong for caring. But I was wrong for thinking that effort alone was enough to fix something this unbalanced.

Ex is back in town,"Broken up for 6 months. No contact for three months. She broke no contact to let me know she’s here for the summer. We’ve been hanging out. 

It’s clear that we both host a great deal of love for the other person. Logistically the relationship can’t work long distance (5,000 miles). 

The boundary has been placed down and we both agree that we won’t be rekindling anything. 

Being in touch again, seeing each other, texting, feels like I have to love her with my hands tied behind my back. It blows. 

To hear her explain to me how much she hurt too during the breakup was nice validation. To hear that she hasn’t moved on and thinks highly of me is great validation. 

Apparently I made her standards so high that she doubts she’ll have another relationship anytime soon. Talk about an ego boost. 

But I’m expected to act as a platonic friend, and I will. I’ll enjoy every moment I can with her before she’s gone again and we lose each other again. 

It hurts. I’d like to feel her soft lips on mine in the shower. I’d like to sleep with her in my arms just one more time.

Support system,"I just ended a 7 year relationship.

I just went on a trip with some friends and it was the best 5 days of my life but it came with hard decisions I knew I had to make when I returned. I met a new friend that was the cousin of the good friend who invited me on the trip. We instantly clicked and had a lot in common and turned out shared trauma. They shared how they recently just got out of a 6 year relationship 6 months ago. We spent the night and next night staying up just talking about our trials and tribulations of our common issues we had in our relationship. They gave me their opinions and of course was hoping that their opinions wouldn't lead me to the solution of ending my 7 year relationship. But when a complete stranger we all met on our trip was giving us all advice and gave me advice that just hit right on the nail and hit home so hard. I just knew what I had to do.

All of my friends were so supportive and it was the first time that I ever got drunk to drown all my emotions that were now surfacing that I kept locked away for so long. But that one person held me down the most in those 5 days. And now that were returned from the trip and I am going through this very emotional time. I am having the hardest time coping with everything because the one person that kept me grounded so much isn't here. I know they have their own life to live and are enjoying the freedom that they have been living ever since then but it just fucking sucks that I don't hear from them as often as I thought I would. I am happy that I get what they are able to give when they can but fuck I wish I could lean on them more.

My ex reached out. But avoidants don't really change.,"I was in a relationship with an avoidant long before I understood attachment theory and what that meant, but I recognized the pattern before the end of the relationship. Surviving on crumbs, trying to convince myself I didn't need my affections or attention reciprocated, going through the push-pull cycle, basically everything that comes along with being in a relationship with an avoidant. Most everything said here is true. We'd had the same conversation a half dozen times about my emotional needs and how the relationship was becoming unhealthy. The post not long ago that likened the breadcrumbing stage to addiction was remarkably accurate.

I happened to make a friend that is still recovering from her previous relationship, also with a textbook avoidant. I started talking with her about our experiences, which was actually extremely helpful. To understand that you're not alone, and the thought processes and experiences you went through (or are going through) are not unique. Unfortunately. I also started listening to a podcast (or YouTube channel, rather) by Craig Kenneth, who seems to deal quite a bit with the aftermath of a relationship with an avoidant. Ironically, the day I was listening to a segment on the phases avoidants go through after a relationship ends, she reached out to me.

At this point it hadn't been terribly long, maybe a month. We weren't strictly no contact, spoken or unspoken, but had only texted once or twice in that span. And like he said she would, it was about something else entirely. But she asked how I was, and while people yell at me for engaging when I shouldn't, I responded. Ironically, my ex (the avoidant in question) used to get upset that I would talk to my ex-wife, who cheated on me and did her best to nuke the relationship from orbit when she left. I have to co-parent so we have no choice but to communicate. So she knows (or should know) that if I respond to my ex-wife, who did me horribly wrong, out of politeness or duty then I will respond to her.

Anyway the conversation became ""friendly."" At this point I'm guarded, obviously. And while they say time heals, I think time removes the rose hue from your vision little by little, and you become more objective. So while you initially miss the relationship and romanticize much or all of it, as you are able to think about it more clearly you might understand it wasn't what you thought it was. So I'm not missing it nearly as much as I was. At the same time, I'm realizing that there's no good reason to be talking to me other than she misses me. It could be boredom or loneliness, but why me? I'm aware of this, mind you, and in talking to my friends (two women, actually) they both say she misses me, obviously, and might be fishing for something.

So now it's been over two weeks of mostly small talk. Why am I entertaining this? Well, for one, I'm polite, and I don't like to ignore people. And I don't have the heart yet to say no more. though if I were to engage with a new love interest I would have to cut that off regardless of it being small talk or not. But I'm also very curious as to what she wants. I'm pretty sure she misses me. So I have been talking a bit, letting her do most of the initiating. I am not bringing up anything emotional or steering the conversation. She's alluded once to getting together with an implication of...well, you know. There's a small part of me, the eternal optimist, that wants her to have changed, even a little. That thinks she does miss me, and I'm waiting for her to bring it up, to try to address things, a path forward. But this would require her communicating openly about her emotions and ultimately risk rejection. This is \*not\* something avoidants do. So I'm engaging in otherwise pointless small talk waiting to see if she will address the elephant in the room, or if it really is nothing more than pointless small talk with no conceivable goal. Maybe she hopes we'd get together, sparks would fly, and we'd just restart the same unhealthy push-pull cycle without ever addressing anything. The avoidant's dream, I suppose. But I'm not doing that.

The moral of this story is in the title. Avoidants don't change. Or rather don't expect them to.",6,4,2025-06-28 13:43:27,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmn59z/my_ex_reached_out_but_avoidants_dont_really_change/,,,"Be guarded. Ypu should be. And I'm with you here, walking the same path. Only accountability and and evidence of real change and self reflection/growth can alter the outcomes you've experienced in the past.

If it is, then gradually pacing. ||| I did the cycle with mine about 4 times and each time it got worst and worst and usually she went farther and farther away.

Right now shes just bread crumbing you because she doesn't know what she wants I swear all of them are like that.   The one time mine broke up with me I hadn't seen her in like a month then she needed a week of being alone and I got fed up with it and told her wtf is going on why are you so distant. Boom breakup and what happened next was that she reached out two weeks later with a ""I miss you"" text and we talked for like 2 weeks till she finally came over and we had a huge talk. We got back together and it was super good for the first 3 months then at the 6 month mark she broke up with me again for the exact same reason. They will pull the rug from under you once again."

What the hell is she doing?,"What the hell is she doing?

I never got over my first love. We were together 2 years, when I had just turned 18,she was 16.i finished with her after a year of long distance didn't work. Tried to get back together with her weeks after our break up, but she chose someone new. Been with him 23 years.

Last year I discovered her following mm E on Twitter. I was at the depths of depression. Decided to message her and conquer some demons. Partner of 16 years found out - forbid me to contact her. 

A year later she finds my new Instagram, initiates contact again. 6 months ago I read DBF and NMMNG. Radical shift in thinking. Now talking with ex incessantly. Clearly protecting her marriage. Won't be drawn on anything. Chatting flirtatious at most but still past a line. Don't want partner of 16 years and mother of 4 kids. Hurt me by withholding far too many times. Lost all feelings for get since 6 months ago. 

What is my ex up to? I want go be with her. Partner 2 weeks ago told me she wanted to split, sell house, didn't love me, checked out of relationship, incompatible, doesn't want to go on holiday with me, doesn't want to grow old witj me, doesn't want to spend time with me. For first time in 16 years I agreed. She backtracked and now acting like nothing happened and everything OK. I don't want her, I want my ex. But she'll never leave her hubby for me, but wants to chat wit me, incessantly. 

Sent her current and past pics. Admits she still finds me attractive. 

Don't want to destroy family but neither will ex so reunion pue in the sky.

Where I Least Expected It,"Every time he broke up with me, he did it with a precision that hurt more than the breakup itself. It wasn’t just the goodbye—it was the way he did it. The cold tone. The empty eyes. As if I had never meant anything, as if all the moments we shared could be erased with a cruel snap of his fingers. He’d tell me he didn’t feel anything anymore, that he was tired of me, that I was too much. Then he’d leave. Just like that. And I’d fall apart.

At first, I broke too. Again and again. Like a vase badly mended, shattering with each blow. But over time, each piece that fell off me also felt like a piece of him that no longer belonged. Slowly, his face blurred in my memory, his voice faded. He had hurt me so deeply that, without knowing it, he pushed me to the edge—where I could finally see myself: wounded, yes, but alive. I began to love the parts of me where he used to live.

And in the middle of it all, there was him… the florist.

Always kind, always calm, always there. He spoke to me with a tenderness that felt like it came from another world. He listened without interrupting. He didn’t ask for anything. He simply stayed. With flowers in his hands and sadness tucked behind his eyes—just like mine. We were both broken, but in each other’s company, there was something soft, something pure. Without realizing it, we created a little space where we could breathe without fear.

We held each other tighter when the past came back to haunt us. We laughed more quietly, as if pain had taught us how to speak in whispers. And one day, we realized: what we had between us was love. Quiet, yes, but real. We didn’t say much. We just held hands. We weren’t in a rush. We both knew the last thing we wanted was to relive the past.

But the ending wasn’t what I expected.

One morning, he didn’t open the flower shop. I got worried. I knocked on the door. I called. I waited. Days later, his sister wrote to me: he had left the country. An unexpected, sudden decision—but one he needed. He left me a short handwritten note.

*""Thank you for showing me I could still feel something beautiful. But I’ve realized I need to be alone for a while, far from everything. Don’t look for me. Take care. And keep blooming.""*

I cried like I hadn’t cried for anyone before. Not out of anger, not out of betrayal. I cried because I understood—not every love comes to stay. Some arrive only to show us we deserve better… even if it’s not with them.

And even though I was left alone again, I didn’t feel empty. Because for the first time, in a long time, I had myself. Whole. And not even the most unexpected goodbye could take that from me.

What Was Left Among the Flowers,"After the breakup, there was nothing left of me that I could recognize. It felt like every corner of my soul was in ruins, as if everything that was once light now burned to ash. I slept little, felt too much, and the days were just a sequence of emptiness I didn’t know how to fill. Until, by pure chance —or maybe fate— I stepped into that flower shop. I was looking for a place where I could breathe without breaking. I didn’t expect it to be him.

He was there, surrounded by living flowers while I was falling apart inside. His hands were stained with soil, and his soul seemed untouched by judgment. He looked at me with a kind of tenderness that didn’t hurt. He didn’t say much, but he offered me a flower. Just one. It wasn’t the prettiest, but there was something about it… something broken and perfect all at once. I took it home like someone clinging to a tiny thread of hope.

I went back. Not because I wanted to see him —or at least that’s what I told myself— but because in that space, among roots and petals, the pain was a little easier to carry. He spoke of flowers as if they were people: of their cycles, their wounds, their quiet strength to keep growing even after being cut. I listened, and though my heart was still in pieces, his words were like water to dry soil.

He never asked what had happened to me. He didn’t need to. He knew, the way flowers know when to bloom and when to close. And without promises, without grand gestures, without urgency… he held me. He saw me whole even when I could only see fragments. And I, afraid, uncertain, with wounds still open… began to feel again. Not an explosive kind of love. Something more raw, more gradual. More real.

Sometimes love doesn’t arrive like fire. Sometimes it comes like a root: hidden, growing quietly, and before you know it… it holds you. He didn’t save me. I saved myself. But I did it because he reminded me how. Because between the scent of flowers and the way he moved through the world, I understood I could still bloom.

Now I know that the loss wasn’t the end. It was the beginning of another version of me: stronger, softer, more true. I learned that even with a shattered heart, life can surprise you. That love can find you in the most unlikely places. That among flowers, soil, and silence… I was born again.

And this time, I don’t need anyone to promise me forever. It’s enough to know that real love doesn’t demand, doesn’t wound, doesn’t shout. It simply *is*. And that… that changes everything.
",1,1,2025-06-28 22:50:32,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmzmrd/what_was_left_among_the_flowers/,,,"You hit rock bottom after the breakup, feeling like nothing of yourself was left. Then, out of nowhere, you found a quiet place where pain softened—a flower shop, a stranger with no judgment, and a small, imperfect flower that somehow gave you hope.  He didn’t fix you. He just showed you how to start growing again, slowly, without pressure or noise. You learned to save yourself. That kind of love doesn’t roar. It just quietly holds space for you to bloom on your own terms.  Loss wasn’t the end. It was the start of a stronger, truer you. Real love isn’t about promises or grand gestures. It just is. And when you get that, everything changes."
Among Petals and Silences,"After my breakup, it felt like everything that had once bloomed inside me had withered. I walked through the city like someone wandering through a memory—aimless, hollow, hoping time would erase the pain. One day, without much thought, I stepped into a small flower shop. I wasn’t looking for anything in particular. Maybe I just wanted to be near something that still knew how to live, how to grow.

That’s where I saw him for the first time. He didn’t smile at me like someone trying to make a sale, but like someone who recognized another soul that had been broken too. He offered me a flower, just one. It wasn’t the brightest or the most exotic, but there was something in its simplicity that held me up. I took it, and unknowingly, I also took my first step toward healing.

I came back, again and again. Sometimes just to look at the flowers. Sometimes to hear his voice gently explaining how every plant has its season, its wounds, its time to bloom. In those quiet moments, I understood that I, too, was allowed that—a winter, a pruning, a pause… and then, a spring.

It wasn’t an instant romance or some grand cinematic story. It was something deeper, more real. We discovered each other like roots growing beneath the surface—slowly, respectfully. He showed me that not all love is loud; some is simply nurtured. And I, with every petal that fell from old memories, made room for something new.

I wasn’t looking for love. I didn’t want to fall again. But love—true love—doesn’t always come crashing in. Sometimes it arrives as a kind gesture, a carefully chosen flower, a conversation without expectations. And without realizing it, I began a new story—not like the last one, but better. Because this time, I wasn’t a broken version of myself. I was someone who had learned how to bloom again.

I’ve come to understand that endings aren’t always losses. Sometimes, they’re doorways. And love—real, quiet, healing love—can find you even among petals and silences, when you least expect it… and when you need it most.
",1,1,2025-06-28 22:47:59,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmzktn/among_petals_and_silences/,,,"You hit a low point after the breakup, feeling like you’d lost your spark. Then you found yourself in a flower shop, not looking for anything but ended up meeting someone who saw your broken pieces without judgment. That simple flower he gave you wasn’t flashy, but it gave you something solid to hold onto.  You kept coming back, learning that growth takes time and patience, just like plants need their seasons. No rush, no drama—just steady, quiet care. That’s the kind of love that sticks, the kind that helps you bloom again when you thought you never would.  You weren’t looking for it, but it found you in the small moments. Endings don’t always mean losing—they can be the start of something better. Real love shows up softly, in petals and silence, exactly when you need it most."
One Last Vent: Sorry I Took You For Granted,"Although you were busy taking care of your life, your college, your son… You always did your best to make time for me, to the point of cancelling *important appointments* just to be with me.

You would even lie to your boss to justify being late for work *just to be able to spend more time with me…*

You stop everything you were doing to go pick me up at work… 

You were always there for me. Doing your best to show your man you loved him and cared about him.

My needyness blinded me to all of these demonstrations of love and companionship.

Made me sometimes mistake them for lack of interest or indifference. I failed you as a partner and I deeply hate myself for this. 

I am deeply sorry for cheating on you instead of trying to see your ongoing struggle to correnspond to my stupid excessive expectations. Sorry for irreversibly breaking your trust. 

I love you. I will forever love you and remember you. You are the most dedicated woman I have ever met.

You screwed up, you owned it, now stand up and carry it like a man. Not to beat yourself with it, but to remind yourself who you’re not gonna be again.  She gave her best. You didn’t match it. That’s truth. But wallowing in it won’t bring her back, and it won’t make you better. Only way forward is to learn, grow, and never repeat it.  Let the lesson change you. Then live like it did."
What Remains After,"In the end, it wasn’t love that I lacked—it was learning how to give it to myself. I was broken, confused, clinging to a “we” that no longer existed. I lost myself looking for him in memories, until I understood that the only thing real was the present—and me within it.

Letting go wasn’t easy. I fought against the urge to go back, against the idea that maybe things could’ve been different. But with time, I learned to breathe without him. To laugh without guilt. To be alone without feeling lonely. I learned that some goodbyes aren’t spoken out loud—but they echo in the soul.

Today, I remember him with warmth, not pain. There are days when his name still crosses my mind like a whisper, but it no longer breaks me. It simply reminds me that I loved truly, and that I was strong enough to move on.

I loved him deeply. Maybe a part of me always will. But I love myself, too. And in the end, that’s what remains. That—and the quiet hope that what’s coming, though different, can still be beautiful.

You finally stopped chasing someone who let go, and started holding onto yourself. That’s real strength. Doesn’t mean it didn’t hurt, doesn’t mean you don’t remember. It means you chose to live anyway.  Love isn’t just about giving it away. It’s about knowing you’re worth keeping some for yourself. And you figured that out. That’s what matters now. Keep walking forward. Eyes up. Heart open. What’s ahead might not be what you planned, but it can still be damn good."
Help please. M28 f34,"So to kind of sum up things I met this man at work and we became friends and after about a year we started dating, he was all the things I was looking for in a man, and we got a long super well, same sense of humor, political values etc. He was super reassuring, I was in love he was in love, pretty normal. However I had a kidney transplant when I was 20…and they don’t last forever. Unfortunately, about 11months into our relationship (saying I love you) my transplant kidney rejected. Now I was fully transparent about everything when we were just friends about my illness, and then when this happened I had a convo with him about how things were gunna be hard and I was gunna be sick, and if he needed to pull back and we can be friends for awhile that’s ok. He said if “I leave you now I never loved you” (haha) any way life continued I was/am doing dialysis, he is still telling me “we’re gunna get married” “we can get through anything” “I love you more than anyone I’ve ever been with” I think things are hard but with him they are good, he’s super supportive. We are both nurses btw. We don’t live together, my family is kinda of traditional so that’s not my thing until marriage, he didn’t care. 

Then in Jan2025 I had to move back in with my parents out of my apartment cause I was just struggling, but I still went to his house as many days a week as I could. But I’m doing dialysis 3x a week…but he Golfs so he does that when we aren’t together. Things are a little boring, he works nights so he’s sleeping all the time, we aren’t alone a lot (he lives with his sister/BIL/niece) but life is continuing and I just think eh it’s our first rough patch we’ve gone through worse things we’ll get back to normal soon. Our 2nd yr anniversary was May 21, we talked about getting married, made sure we were on the same page, then 3 days later he ended things. 

I had texted him earlier that week saying I felt like he was a little down, sleeping all the time, I was worried he was depressed. He said he was feeling kind of down but trying to hide it. I said well let’s talk and see what we can do together to work through it. That’s I thought we were doing when we met up to talk…the first thing he said was “you’re not gonna like this conversation” the breakup lasted 30mins and he was gone. He mumbled “what if you die at 50 and leave me with a kid” (I’m 34 and have no issues except kidney failure, other than that I’m relatively healthy) and “I don’t wanna do this anymore, I’m not happy”. I was completely blindsided, he NEVER said anything to me about being unhappy in our relationship. He has since gone no contact. Won’t answer texts, calls nothing. His sister and BIL will talk to me but they don’t know what happened either. But they say he’s made up his mind and won’t change it. 

I think he is an avoidant personality, he never complained about anything to me, and I kind of had to make sure and be the one to bring up “relationship check-ins” and he said he struggled with that in past relationships. But that didn’t really bother me because he was so forthcoming about his love and our future. 

I’m confused, idk what happened, or what to do. Why didn’t he just talk to me?? We hardly ever had a fight, it wasn’t toxic, no one cheated. wtf happened? I miss him so much, and I miss his friendship. He was my best friend.

You did nothing wrong expecting him to hold the line when things got hard. That’s what love means.  But here’s the thing. Some folks can talk big, dream big, say all the right things — but when life walks through the door with muddy boots, they run. Doesn't matter what he said before. What matters is what he did when it counted. He left. He didn’t fight. He didn’t even explain.  You’re grieving, not just him, but the future you thought was coming. That takes time. But don’t waste that time waiting on someone who chose silence over honesty. If he circles back one day, that’s his cross to carry. You don’t put your life on pause hoping a man finds his spine.  You’re stronger than you know. And I’d bet anything that when the dust settles, you’ll realize you dodged a man who couldn’t love you through the fire. You deserve someone who won’t fold when life gets hard. You keep walking. Let him stay lost if he wants to be."
Got broke up by someone who is an avoidant.,"I (m24) got broken up with by someone who I honestly thought I’d spend the rest of my life with. We were together for over a year, and the past couple of months have been nothing but emotional torture.

I have an anxious attachment style, and he’s avoidant. He wasn’t always like that, but looking back, there were times he was hot and cold. We had so much fun together, and I loved him with all my heart. I prioritized him in every way. I missed him the second we were apart. And he seemed to feel the same way.

We’d argue sometimes, but we’d always make up and move forward. Until a couple of months ago, when everything changed.

But looking back, there is common theme. As I said, he was hot and cold. I would be showered with love and affection, then he would go cold. During the cold periods, I would be begging for the tiniest gestures like checking in or just acknowledging that I texted. I would be starved of emotional connection and be left feeling alone even though he is next to me. 

But I put up with it and waited. I never gave up because I had hope after bringing up and being told that he would put more effort. 

Until a month ago. 

He started texting way less and would leave my messages unopened for hours. He stopped asking to see me or even call to check in. We weren’t intimate for over a month and when I tried to communicate that, I was left feeling terrible. He even flipped his sleep schedule so he’d be awake when all night and sleep during the day, which meant we barely talked at all. It felt like he was avoiding me on purpose. 

I kept trying to bring it up, telling him how distant he felt, but he either brushed it off or said he was just tired or stressed.

I felt like I was losing him bit by bit.

Then he finally broke up with me.

I’m completely shattered. Everything around me reminds me of him. I still love him so much, even though I’m badly hurt. I can’t stop thinking about how amazing he was in the beginning, when he was loving and attentive and made me feel like his whole world.

I just want to say this for anyone else who’s anxiously attached:

Be careful with avoidant people. At the start, they show you this version of themselves that makes you fall so hard. But slowly, they start pulling away and becoming distant, and you’re left feeling like you’re chasing after the person they used to be. The highs feel incredible, but the lows are honestly devastating.",21,21,2025-06-28 06:22:24,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmfx81/got_broke_up_by_someone_who_is_an_avoidant/,,,"Oh honey, I could have written this word for word. This is exactly what happened to me. The last 2-3 months my boyfriend made so many reasons (excuses) why we couldn’t talk, he was busy, stressed, need to wait until the weekend etc  I found myself sending messages trying to persuade him why talking is a neccessary thing in a relationship. He used to call me several times a day in the beginning (sometimes it was almost too much), in the end weeks I’d send a message and 7 hours later get a one word reply. It made me feel crazy. ||| Look after yourself. I have found some interesting/comforting (and somewhat confronting) insights on the reddit group for codependents. ||| Going through the same thing right now.

Not only to anxious attached.   Relationship with avoidant ALWAYS fail with anyone ( except if the avoidant heal) . Just maybe with another avoidant it could "" work "" .    They will see each other 3 time in a decade. It's not a relationship but at least both of them will be free, that is the most important for them . ||| Maybe he's avoidant but ""showering"" someone with compliments and what not can be smothering for anyone. ||| Our last six months are very similar to your last month. We lived together but she changed and leave the house just to avoid me. Cut off almost all texting with me parts of the day we weren't together. Only she cheated and left with him.

I miss every little thing. It sucks ||| It's crazy how I exactly feel the same and have gone through it as well. I would like to know how u are dealing with this since I'm still struggling ||| No one that is looking for a relationship or a stable connection is safe with an avoidant not even secure and they can make even secure people become anxious as well. The worst part about them is always the beginning because they give you a false narrative of who they are or if you break up and get back together you have that new honeymoon phase all over again and the cycle repeats. Trust me I have gone through the same thing as you when they start to pull away your like wtf where are you going please come back. It makes no sense and its really traumatizing to the person on the receiving end of it.   I spent 2.5 years with mine trying to make it work because it would always fluctuate. She would be good for a while then do the slow fade and when I called it out I usually got discarded and then she would come back after a little bit and it would repeat.   The best thing you can do is erase them from your life and do your best to heal and to make it less unbearable but yeah thats going to take time a lot of time actually and yes it really does suck. ||| I'm going through the same thing now. She was avoidant. I am anxious. I got the ""you deserve so much better"" line too.  This is hell!"
Still missing after 8 months,"I broke up with my ex-girlfriend 8 months ago. We had a toxic relationship, at the last stages I tried so hard to improve (therapy, reading, meds for anxiety, etc), but I just felt that she sabotaged things on purpose. During this 8 months I being contacting her intermittently, there are periods of no contact that last 1 month or maximum half a month. Right now she doesn’t want to talk with me anymore, not even as friends, she’s gone absolutely cold. I still struggle to believe her behavior because she treated me with so much love (I also do remember the times were she didn't) that I just can’t understand why she left so harshly. 

It’s been so hard. Insanely hard. One thing that has me going is the gym, I’m disciplined there but when I arrive home I just miss her so much. I don’t know if I’m just obsessed or infatuated with her, or it’s just attachment. It’s like she has so much power over me and she’s not even here anymore. I’m very nostalgic and I always see her with so much love and sweetness so seeing her as a bad person or seeing her flaws is so difficult for me. I just don’t know if I should keep waiting, or what words can I say to her so she would listen to me one more time or if I just should loose all hope.",2,4,2025-06-28 18:25:22,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmtqbz/still_missing_after_8_months/,,,"It’s just an attachment ||| I mean -I feel for you, truly, but also, you broke up with her, and you stayed in contact but you never made an effort to reconciliate. So why are you now surprised that she stopped waiting around and gave up on you? You had every chance to value her and chose distance instead. People deserve to be seen and valued consistently, not only when it's convenient for you or on your own timeline. I understand it hurts but maybe this can teach you  how to show up better in the future. You can still reach out one last time, being fully honest and open, and let her decide what to do with it. But afterwards you need to let her be."
how do i get over him?,"me (f15) and this boy (m14) dated for almost a year and a half, and nearly two months ago he broke up with me. it was both his and my first relationship, and i dont know how to get over him. every week i feel differently, going from hating his guts to feeling like he's the most perfect person ever. i talk to a lot of people about it, and i cant tell if i'd want to get back together or not if he ever asked (which i doubt he would). i feel like i'm just lying in wait hoping for closure at least, and maybe even another chance. i dont know if to get help here i should give you more information about us or how we ended, if i do i can try to update or edit this to explain more. thanks to anyone who can give me advice, and good luck to you all with your breakups.",1,6,2025-06-28 22:07:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmypnw/how_do_i_get_over_him/,,,"youre sooo young! you have your whole life ahead of you, so many new experiences awaiting, so many new people youve yet to meet. i know its incredibly difficult to get over someone youve spent so much of your time with but stay positive always and a few months/years later you’ll look back and realise how different your life was back then. ||| You get over him by stopping the waiting game. That back-and-forth rollercoaster in your head? That’s your heart stuck in limbo, not your future. Hate him one minute, love him the next—that’s normal, but it won’t get you anywhere.  Closure or another chance? Probably not coming. So stop banking on what he might do. Focus on what you can control—yourself. Stop chasing the idea of him and start figuring out who you are without him.  It’s okay to feel mixed up. You’re 15. First heartbreaks hit hard. But don’t let it own you. Keep busy, keep learning, keep living. Time and distance will dull the pain. And one day, you’ll look back and realize you’ve moved on without even noticing it. That’s how you win."
Watching my ex emotional breakdown was amazing.,"Long story short childhood friends who went our separate ways and met in our 20s again. 

I wound up buying a house shortly after our lease had ended.  I had a gut feeling during that time period she was planning something I wasn’t informed of. We dated for 5 years and lived together. The weirdness started happening towards the end of our lease and after confirmation on the house. 

Well come to find out she met a girl while gaming who looks normal at first glance but is probably destructive and manipulative somehow talked her into being roommates for a year across the country. 


This is really weird to explain or put into words but the morning of the day she told me that I had started deleting all of our old saved Snapchat conversations and iMessages. Going behind my back and not being a surprise party is cause to relationship termination in my eyes. 


Ill save you a long story but In her head, her friend had convinced her she can take a break from the relationship to “go be young.”  In their late 20s. Terrible life choice btw and that I’ll probably still be around.



Watching the emotional breakdown play out when she’s asking why I was deleting memories was fun. I don’t think she had fully cemented her idea into going but I gave her no other option since her income alone isn’t enough to rent locally to where we lived.  She used the excuse of staying at her parents and visiting before moving as an excuse to contemplate.


She’s basically homeless, jobless and penniless from what I’ve heard and is now involved with very questionable people/circumstances as her parents cut her off due to her indecisive nature. 


The downfall of someone looking to emotionally scar you and financially use you after getting involved with a tainted person is great!!! I’ve also found out she’s resorted with her “new friend” of entertaining men for money.


My ex had a good job for a travel company and then in tech and is now giving entertainment to make rent. 


A small part of me is sad that my kind and smart childhood best friend went down that path, but to go behind my back my put that before a sustainable easy life is rewarding karma. It’s one of those situations where you never truly know someone or they change? 


Either way I couldn’t imagine having someone you could trust in your life and financially/career wise helped you succeed to doing sex acts to make rent. What a human pile of trash I wasted a decade of my life with.

i don’t think i’ve been the same since my friendship breakup at 13,"This might sound weird but I’m 21F and of course I’ve had friends in the past since I was 13, but it just doesn’t feel the same. I feel like, I haven’t been the same since I was 13 when it comes to friendships. When I look back at how I was when I was 13 I feel like I put in a lot more effort in my friendships, whereas I lately just adopted a “whatever I don’t care attitude”. When I was 13 I went through a really bad friendship breakup with two people who I had been friends with since I first started school and I don’t know, I just haven’t been the same since. I’ve had friends since then but the effort I put in doesn’t seem like the amount of effort I put into those friendships when I was 13. Like looking back I genuinely don’t think I’ve had as close of a friendship as I did back then with those two people because I don’t know, I guess I was scared of getting close to people. And maybe that sounds bad but it made me realise lots of people I could consider acquaintances but are they my friends? Probably not. I don’t know. I was just reflecting on it. I feel like after I confronted them a few months after the friendship breakup and I heard what happened and why it happened (which was my fault, I definitely take full accountability of that) I was scared of getting close to anyone again in case I hurt anyone. I think this might also translate to my romantic relationships as well, I haven’t been in any romantic relationship in my whole life and it’s because I’m scared of getting hurt. It seems weird, I don’t know. ",1,1,2025-06-28 21:54:47,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmyg39/i_dont_think_ive_been_the_same_since_my/,,,"Ain’t weird at all. It’s just human.  You got burned young, and it left a mark. That first real heartbreak, even if it’s “just” a friendship, hits like a freight train when you’re still figuring out who you are. And if you blamed yourself for it, deep down, you’ve probably been carrying that guilt ever since. Quietly. Letting it tell you, “Don’t get too close again. You’ll just mess it up.”  That’s not weakness. That’s a wound. And you’ve been guarding it so long, you forgot what it’s like to open up without fear.  But listen close: it’s time to stop living like the mistake you made at 13 is the full story of who you are. You’re not that kid anymore. You’ve grown. You’ve learned. And you deserve connection, same as anyone else.  Being scared doesn’t make you broken. It just means you’ve got some healing to do. You don’t fix it by forcing yourself into friendships or relationships. You fix it by being honest with yourself, like you’re doing now, and slowly letting yourself believe you’re allowed to be close again.  Start small. Be real. Let people in one piece at a time. And when the right ones come along, give them a chance. You’ve got more to offer than you think."
One day I’ll be okay and grateful,"It’s been about 3 ish months, I think since my last relationship ended. We lived together, had breakfast, had our dogs, and it was our space. It’s been hard adjusting to life without that anymore, but time heals all. We don’t talk anymore, losing my best friend sucks. I miss the company and the shared laugh at our inside jokes, and even if things didn’t end on better terms one day I’ll be able to look back and say thank you. Thank you for the amazing memories, thank you for the love and support I needed and received from you, and thank you for this opportunity as crappy as it may seem to better myself and fix the parts of me that need fixing. Some days are really crappy, some days are really stinking lonely. But one day I won’t be, one day I’ll have someone who I can be completely vulnerable with and I’ll strive to be a better person to earn that love. Love isn’t something that should be taken for granted, I lost sight of that and I lost the girl. Wherever we end up in the world i honestly just want you  to be happy. I’ve got a lot of work to do but the idea that one day I’ll be happy, things will be better, kids of my own someday that I can share my life with, that’s a day worth waking up for so I’ll keep pushing and aiming towards that.",1,2,2025-06-28 21:52:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmydyj/one_day_ill_be_okay_and_grateful/,,,"Proud of you.

Recorded this a while back… funny how pain circles back.,"🎧 Listen here: https://on.soundcloud.com/uaK1p0l6LCmrno6RG3

I wrote and recorded “Hold On” a couple years ago and never released it. Thought I was past what I felt back then, guess not.

The pain resurfaced recently after finally blocking my ex fiancee after her bread-crumbing and leading me on post break up , and this song found me again.

Decided to finally share it. If you’re going through something, maybe it’ll speak to you too.

Last week I noticed that she was most likely searching me up on linkedin either in private mode or through the search bar. She knows I deleted her number and that I dont have any other social media atm.  

Is it likely that she's just checking up on me out of curiousity or she's missing the idea of me?

WHY YOU FEEL NUMB AS THE GIVER IN THE RELATIONSHIP?,"You didn’t suddenly stop caring. You didn’t become cold or indifferent. What you’re feeling, or not feeling, is numbness. 

And that numbness isn’t a sign of failure or brokenness. It’s your nervous system doing its job: protecting you!!!! 

As givers, deep lovers who love HARDDDD we face repeated emotional pain from the disappointment birthed from the lack of reciprocity in the relationship. 

The ongoing frustration, the burnout, the constant dissatisfaction, and often, the lack of gratitude; it all takes a toll. Over time, your body steps in and says, “That’s enough.” It triggers a freeze response, known as hypoarousal. This is when you disconnect emotionally, shut down, and dissociate; not because you don’t care, but because your system can’t take any more. 
Feeling it all; the GRIEF, the heartbreak, the weight of being the strong one; all at once  shatters you. You were filling the cracks, lifting and carry the weight of the relationship in hopes things will change.

But let this be your gentle reminder: you are not broken. The numbness you feel isn’t the absence of emotion; it’s the evidence of how deeply you feel.

So please, pause. Post breakup you have the opportunity to reflect on what really the relationship was about. Allow yourself to feel again, slowly, safely. Refill before you pour. Reconnect with what nourishes you. You don’t have to be everything to everyone. But you do need to come home to yourself.

I was blindsided, but agreed to breakup because he revealed and I saw how much he was mentally suffering. What I thought was supposed to be a happy day turned into a nightmare. He ended the relationship to work on himself, to ""get out"" of the safety net I was for him.   I was a HUGE giver because I love hard (and also because I didn't want him to worry about accumulating more debt - he was addicted to collecting trading cards.) Over the course of our 13 years,  I always supported him financially. I paid for his college tuition, I paid his credit card debt off in full, twice. I always paid for our vacations. I bought him a laptop for college, clothes, shoes, small everyday things. I don't have steep expenses and luckily I'm satisfied with my career and income. I make almost twice his income so I did not mind paying for everything. A rough estimate of what I spent on him in terms of tuition, credit card debt would be around $50,000.   I would always plan our dates, vacations, our plans. I would help clean his room and fold his laundry even though he never asked.  I'd make sure he was up to date with his doctor, eye, and dentist appointments. I made sure he had a clean bottle and cold water when he went to work. I did all that because I loved him deeply.  He left because he said he felt he was getting too comfortable and it was unhealthy to rely on me. He left to be better mentally, spiritually,  physically and financially. He said he would come back as a friend, but it hurts he didn't want to grow together with me when I gave him my all - my entire heart, my sweat, and tears.   The money never mattered to me. I never expected him to pay me back and I still don't. On the day we broke up (our anniversary), I still made him take the new phone I bought for him. I will always be a giver for him. I would still give my life for his. I would still pay off his debt in a minute if he needed. Let me be clear - he was not a leech and I never felt used because he would always refuse my financial help. He's gone no contact now to try to heal, grow and be better.   So I'm left feeling numb like I'm frozen in time, but also immensely depressed and heartbroken. It's hard to refill before I pour. I want to be everything to him again, but understand that we have to start as friends again in the future before getting back together. It's hard coming home to myself when my heart is still with him.

There were some nights she wouldn’t even let me touch her when we slept together. In hindsight that’s probably when she was thinking about breaking up with me. In the end of the relationship she admitted to my face that she just doesn’t find me attractive anymore.   The moment she realized she can’t get more from me when I was already going above and beyond for her she felt like I deserved nothing from her. all my efforts were just not good enough for her.

Is it okay to still be friends after a breakup?,My bf of almost 3 years broke up with me about 3 weeks ago. I obviously still feel heart broken but we ended on pretty good terms. We still talk occasionally ( we are figuring out living situations since we shared an apartment) and he said he would be okay with still being friends but is that a good idea? He was my best friend and really the only person i ever talked to. The last couple of times we’ve seen each other after the breakup we have an awkward hug and greeting but then once we start talking it feels like old times. we have been good with keeping it platonic but every time he leaves i immediately burst into tears. I don’t want to go no contact but im scared if we keep talking and being friends i am going to lose my mind and not get over him. i don’t know where to go from here. does anyone else have experience with this? ,1,6,2025-06-28 21:31:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmxxys/is_it_okay_to_still_be_friends_after_a_breakup/,,,"You don't have to go No Contact, but having long talks in the living room is probably not a good idea. ||| No. Relationship has ended and that means move on and leave each other for good.

For some people, that space is indefinite. Communicate with him what you need so you both can move on, and respect each other’s decisions. ||| Not ideal to be friends right now at least especially as you are vulnerable. Probably not ideal to be friends in general, as new partners generally won't favour this outcome.   The ideal situation is you move forward, keep contact minimal to 0 (I guess you still have to talk to finish arranging living situations) but after that I would avoid speaking to them. You've got a long road of healing ahead of you, so I suggest you don't make it longer than need be.   You got this :)"
"I ended a one year relationship, because she didn't want to be exclusive.","A week ago I (M33) ended a one year relationship, because she (F34) didn't want to be exclusive.

When we met each other, I was actually in a non-exclusive relationship with someone else, and it was quite difficult for me as that other girl would both see many other people and interact with me in a very couple-y way. So we started as non-exclusive and she kinda became my ""feel good"" relationship compared to the other, ""fury-passion"" one. With her I felt emotionally secure and it was just very sweet. So when the fury-passion one left me 10 months ago because she had met someone with whom she pictured a future together, I felt quite vulnerable and the feel-good relationship became a place where I could find solace.

The relationship was very good, sex was amazing, and everytime we had a little talk about the relationship she said she wasn't seeing anyone else. Except at one point, when she told me she'd seen someone for a month but it didn't work out ; it was already past, so I didn't make more of it. In Winter she said she was like in a little cocoon and wasn't especially interested with meeting new people, but still wanted to be non-exclusive, and that was fine with me, as I wasn't sure about committing with her either.

For all the beginning of this year both of us still weren't seeing anyone else. We were messaging each other every day, seeing each other once a week, and I just started to really like her, feel at ease with her, feel emotionally secure. She even invited me to spend time at her friend's house in Italy during the summer holidays. So when one month ago she un-invited me, saying she wasn't comfortable as we never travelled together and this was her girl-friends-trip etc, I was kinda hurt. It felt like she wasn't trusting me to behave or something. So we had another talk about the relationship, and that's when she told me she had met someone new. Didn't even kiss him or anything, just met him and was messaging him.

Well, hearing that kinda fucked me up. Of course I knew we were non-exclusive, but none of us had been seeing someone else for months at that point. I suddenly felt very insecure and asked to understand more what I was to her. She said I was her ""relationship"" and she doesn't do multi-relational. So it's like, I'm the main guy, but she likes being open to new encounters.

This whole thing made me feel very bad and I started to realized everything had been going so well for months because even though we were non-exclusive, we weren't seeing anyone else and that made me feel very secure and appreciated. A week later I offered her to be exclusive. To which she said no. Ideally she wants a couple in the future, but right now she's good in her life as is, and she doesn't picture going further with me. Well that burnt like hell. After one year, after so many intimate moments, after us being present for each other during hard times, hearing that didn't feel good at all.

So a week ago we saw each other and talked about it again. I just had to ask her whether she had met with the other guy again. She said yes, and they kissed. Well, upon hearing that I understood I just couldn't do it. For me, making love is now synonym of making it with her, kissing is kissing her, she ended up taking so much space in my life without me even looking for it. After one year, it's just too hard to think she does the same with someone else as she does with me. It's like it's meaningless now. So we had to accept the truth : it wasn't possible for me anymore if she was seeing someone else at the same time, and it still wasn't possible for her to be exclusive with me, as for her it's being a couple and she doesn't see that with me, at least for now. We both cried. I feel weird. And at the same time it's a weight that's off my shoulders. I'm sad, I miss her. But she made her choice too and I don't see how I could continue, considering how much this relationship has come to mean for me.",1,0,2025-06-28 21:25:23,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmxt19/i_ended_a_one_year_relationship_because_she_didnt/,,,
"Rollercoaster: Pregnancy, miscarriage and sudden break up","This is a bit of a long story. I met my ex in December of last year (2024), we dated until March. We met on a dating website, I joined the website out of curiosity. She caught my eye, and we hit it off right away over messages and met within a couple weeks in person. We shared a lot of the same interests and passions. The only thing that was a bit difficult was, she is a young mother. She has a 1 and a half year old daughter. That along with about an hour geographical distance. She lived about 40 miles North from me. She's 20 years old, and I'm 24. It felt a bit stressful entering into that potential reality of entering a serious relationship with a child involved, especially because I'm still in school (started college late) and we are both still figuring out our life directions and so on. Either way, our first couple of months of dating were passionate, fun, tumultuous and confusing. We certainly shared a connection and it was very special. She is an incredibly thoughtful, creative and caring person, who has experienced a lot of misfortune in her life. We both have semi unconventional attitudes towards the world. Interested in self-sustainability, intentional communities, minimalism, agriculture/growing your own food, ecology, the arts, social and climate justice. We seemed like a great match in so many ways. Yet regarding her child, I felt an inner conflict of whether or not this was what I wanted, in some ways I saw her being a perfect partner, in other ways I felt this dissonance of uncertainty. I was very upfront about my inner conflict and uncertainty with her, and she communicated that she was open to continuing exploring the relationship, even amidst my uncertainty. This was my first relationship in 7 years (since adulthood) and I know one of my weaknesses is taking relationships too seriously right off the bat. It was something that was conditioned when I was younger by my parents. This sort of mentality can suck the joy of just ""getting to know"" someone and insert a lot of anxieties like ""is this the right person??"" We both felt strongly attracted to one another and there was a lot of joy in the relationship even amidst some of the emotional instability. As the relationship deepened and became more intimate, I hit a breaking point in the middle of March. During a panic attack, I called her and told her I wanted to break up. I then offered to sit down in person a few days after and just talk about things and try to find some closure. I came to the conclusion that I didn't have the bandwidth to manage the relationship at this time, that as much as I liked her and desired to continue the relationship, it just didn't seem like the right time. She was heartbroken, but understood and it felt like we ended on a good note. She said that ""her door would always be open"" if I ever felt like revisiting the relationship down the road. Following the breakup I was tortured with regret. Feeling like I gave up too soon, and made a mistake. I was very heartbroken even though I was the one that ended everything. 



Flash forward to May, I receive a message from her (she asked to go no contact) saying ""hey I know we went no contact but I need to talk to you about something, it's important"". We had waited to be sexually active and only had sex once, it was without protection due to it being sort of ""in the moment"". Foolish I know. Immediately my mind goes to ""oh shit, she's pregnant"". Sure enough, she was 9 weeks pregnant--almost tracing exactly to the day we had sex. To be honest, I felt oddly at peace. When we met up to talk about everything, I felt so happy to be in her presence again, to talk with her and laugh with her. It obviously was a stressful situation, but it felt perhaps like fate, and that something was falling into place. We both didn't want to abort the child, so we agreed to talk about the options. Adoption, co parenting or doing it together as a couple. We wanted to take our time and process our emotions and make a smart decision. She stressed that she didn't want me to start the relationship again just because of the child, she didn't want me to feel pressured to be in a relationship I didn't want. But we both said that our ideal situation would be raising the child together as a couple. About 2 weeks later, we made the decision that we could start the relationship again and aim to raise this child together. SO many emotions, but overall I was feeling hopeful, and that it wasn't the child that was making me restart the relationship, but the pregnancy did reorient my mentality towards having a family and being a father, which sort of broke down the wall of hesitation I had the first time around dating her. At this point, the universe had chosen this path for me, and I was going to accept it and see it as possibly the greatest gift of my life unfolding. We both seemed to be keeping our chins up and began to daydream about the future. Feeling like we were aligning in what we wanted our futures to look like, the strengths we share as a couple and how we would make a great team. A week later, she miscarried (at 12 weeks). 



This obviously hit hard, a total emotional rollercoaster. In the aftermath of the miscarriage, I told her ""everything we talked about regarding our relationship, aren't any less true now that the child is gone. We should continue this relationship"". Now feeling more certain and realistic about the relationship, I knew I wanted to continue exploring it, now with the pressure of having a child off the table. She shared the same view and we continued to see each other. She was carrying a lot of grief from the loss, and I was trying to be sensitive and strong for her. It felt like things were falling into place, we were spending a good amount of time together, most weekends and maybe once or twice during the week. In her personal life, she was dealing with a lot. She was finally settling on a custody agreement with her daughters father (it was an abusive situation and she had been the sole caregiver for her daughter--until the courts decided 50/50 custody in June), she had been out of work for a few weeks, and trying to decide what direction she wanted to take with school/career. Amidst all of this we had been making plans, I finally met her parents/family, she was spending more time around my family and she asserted to become ""facebook official"" lol. Things seemed to be going well, even amidst all the messiness of what had just happened in the past month and a half. 



Until one Friday two weeks ago. We signed up to run a 5k together, had trained for it, and I was planning to go to work, and drive to her place after work/spend the night and run the 5k with her in the morning the next day. Until I received a text. ""I've thought long and hard about how to say this, and writing it is the best way I can express my true, clear feelings..."" Yup. A breakup text. Just like that. Out of nowhere. She gave several reasons. I'm a Christian, I attend the episcopal church, I'm generally a more ""liberal"" christian, but still very passionate about my faith, theology etc. She had been baptized the summer before and had considered herself a Christian, but was on the fence about a lot of things. She is also Native American, and felt a dissonance between her cultural faith traditions and Christian teaching, struggling sometimes to integrate them. Rightly so, and I had tried to be sensitive to this, being open to having theological conversations, but eager to learn and understand her native beliefs also--and generally gave the vibe of being willing to compromise wherever she felt needed. She just didn't communicate about this, she had shown interest in the episcopal tradition, and we attended some services together and even after we broke up the first time she continued to apparently attend the episcopal church. She had said ""it was the first church experience I had where I felt I belonged"". In her text, different spiritual paths were her first reason, she felt that we would never be on the same page about faith/religion and were moving in different directions. She saw that I was passionate about my faith, but felt she couldn't meet me there. (once again, she never brought these concerns to me before this). Her second reason was feeling overwhelmed by life and not having time to properly grieve the loss of the child. That was essentially her breakup message. She said I didn't do anything wrong and I inspire her everyday by how I care for others and how my faith guides me through life. She thanked me for everything. End of message. I was completely blindsided. Shocked. Angry. Confused. I sent her several messages saying ""I understand you're going through a lot right now, and I can give you the space you need, but could we please talk more about this in person before we end everything?"" After leaving me on read for awhile, she responded that she can't do that, and she was sorry for how she dropped this on me the way she did. The next day I sent another message saying I want to fight for this, and that I'm hurt how she wants to end the relationship with one text without being willing to at least talk about these things. At that point she sent another message reaffirming her first points, adding that she hasn't felt alignment with our future goals and sees the geographical distance getting in the way of things. ""As much as I wish I could see past those things, I just don't see it working out long term. It's not fair to keep entertaining this between us. I haven't been honest with myself or you."" I attempted one more time, asking to at least sit down and end things with some closure and a conversation, so that I wouldn't fight anymore. I just wanted to understand. ""I'm sorry for dropping this on you the way I did, but I'm not interested in talking about it anymore. This isn't a decision I'm unsure about or planning on revisiting. It's over for me. I care about what we had, but I'm not in the place to continue discussing it. I'm sorry."" At this point I accepted she wouldn't budge and sent a heartfelt message thanking her for the relationship and affirming the wonderful things about her and our time together. She left me on read and blocked me everywhere.

I've been crippled with heartbreak. I've never experienced pain like this before. I don't understand. It came out of nowhere. Did I do something to cause this? I've replayed moment after moment in my mind. After the miscarriage she said ""I'm still willing to move to your city, what do you say?"" I hesitated and suggested that it might be best to put the brakes on some of the plans we made when we were expecting the child. I didn't want her to uproot her life just for me, someone she's only known for 6 months, plus with the custody situation it would've been an hour drive for pick up/drop off. I've wondered if that made her feel like I wasn't truly committed? In so many ways I tried to affirm that I was serious about continuing the relationship, yet I didn't want to make any long term commitments that I wasn't certain I could keep. I just wanted to allow the relationship to grow naturally, once the miscarriage happened. Everyday I wake up with a pain in my chest, anger, and sadness. I feel incredibly mad about how she ended things. Unwilling to sit down and look me in the eyes and say what she needed to say. We continued to be physically intimate (protection and precaution this time of course) and everything I was receiving from her was green flags that she had feelings for me and desired to continue the relationship. I feel like she ripped my heart out, spat on it and trampled it. In one of her messages she said ""I've been sitting with these things for awhile, and I know it's over for me"". Yet she didn't feel it worthwhile to communicate these things? Instead just going along with everything? So utterly confused and heartbroken. I don't know what to do.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I just needed to get it all out. If you have any thoughts, support or questions I'd love to have some connection. I've been really low. A pain I've never felt before. It felt like a surreal dream. And now I'm on the other side, feeling like ""what the fuck just happened?"". Hope you all are well and getting through whatever heartbreak y'all are experiencing right now.

I think I’m getting over him,"I was in love with our memories, how sweet he USED to be during the first year, and the idea of him, his little quirks and how he would be there for me even though he didn’t really have a choice but to be there. The rest of the years he became kind of a jerk, never listened to my needs and I got frustrated. Instead of leaving him and realizing he would never change for me, I hurt him and was afraid of having no one. I don’t think he really loved or liked me, more so liked the way I looked. 

During the end of our 1st year, we took a 4 month break. I was completely alone but at peace, I took myself out, my skin was glowing and I got skinnier but I was still missing him and he took me back. The second and third year he made 0 effort to see me, always claiming to be busy while making time for his friends or even going out with new girls he would befriend and just throwing money at me like it would resolve anything. 

He looked at me with contempt those years and instead of leaving me, he wasn’t physically there for me. There would be some sprinkle of love mixed in here and there. He wouldn’t even be intimate with me or talk to me about his issues, I would always have to initiate conversations. He was always irritated at me. Anyways I don’t know, I’m happy I’m getting over him. I got to meet some nice men who made me realize that most men aren’t that bad and he wasn’t 1 in a million. I do miss him here and there but I think once you love someone and they gave you good memories, a part of you always will.

Disorganized Attachment,"So, as most of us do during a breakup, we try to reflect. So I dated this nice girl for only 11 months. Now looking back, I think she has a disorganized attachment. She would say “I need you.” If I asked what? She would say “you know” She unfortunately has trauma like the rest of us. She has panics attacks and disassociates. She tried to please me a lot. In fact, that’s the things that anger me the most. I think she thinks you earn love not with all these gifts. She’s 21 and still has stuff animals. She would say goodnight to them lol. Her hat if she lost it she went bonkers. I don’t think she even can identify emotions. She said because I was sad at time that it made her feel guilty. The ending wasn’t completely ghosted she said maybe a break and she broke up with me and left with a kiss. So,I was left with it’s my fault because I was sad and anxious at times. Wondering if she just found someone else to latch on. Her mother reached out to check on me and she said she just doesn’t want a relationship and wants to hang out with friends and the camp staff she met. 

Context:
We met worked at camp and I remember meeting her minding my own business. She left her ex eventually because she admitted she liked me one night. She told me the breakup was mutual. I accidentally went inside when she broke up while he was just sitting with her quiet as can be. So, yeah we built that relationship and hung out and all that shit. As time went on, I got triggers my sadness from the stupidest shit like hanging out with her friends. Eventually she said she just wanted a boyfriend and left. 

I’m trying to think of more examples. I just cannot think. Especially, after the camp we had, it’s hard to remember. ",1,0,2025-06-28 21:06:23,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmxe4m/disorganized_attachment/,,,
He Left Right Before Proposing,"How does someone do this. We had a good relationship. He didn’t even try. He just got up and left. Didn’t even communicate anything beforehand. Avoidant discard???

It’s been almost 3 months since this happened so I’m getting over the breakup hump lol, but it’s hard still. But like WTFFFF?! 

Men who are dumpers- can you explain abruptly leaving your woman/family without communicating? Is it avoidance? Why didn’t he communicate concerns or doubts before? It seems kind of odd. Maybe there’s a 3P involved? 

Either way, I was so committed to him and committed to both of our lives and growth, and I hope he can find someone who commits to him like I did honestly because I thought this was the real deal till death do us part.

"I broke up with my boyfriend — he loved me, but it still felt like I was carrying everything. Am I wrong for expecting more?","Okay so, I broke up with my boyfriend recently. It wasn’t some dramatic falling out or cheating issue — I just got tired. Tired of feeling like I was doing all the emotional labor, like I was constantly adjusting and explaining myself while barely getting the same energy back.

To be clear: I know he loved me. I never doubted that. But the way he showed it just didn’t land. He’s very prideful — only child, used to doing things his way, not super expressive through actions. Like, yes, he’d say “I love you,” and yes, he’d make time to see me… but that was pretty much it. No initiative, no thoughtfulness, nothing extra. It always felt like I had to spell everything out for him. Even stuff like bringing something when he first met my mom? Nothing. Valentine’s? Nothing planned. Monthsaries? Never remembered. And when we ate out, it was always KKB.

Meanwhile, I was bending over backwards trying to adjust. I struggle with expressing emotions, yes, but I tried. I communicated, I gave what I could through my love language, and I really cared. I was never a perfect girlfriend, but I was present. And eventually, I just got tired of giving effort while always having to lower my standards to match what little I was getting.

And then I realized: this is why I wanted him to court me in the beginning. I wasn’t being pa-hard or traditional — I just wanted to know if he was worth taking a risk for. I was going through a lot at the time, and I needed reassurance before jumping into something serious. He didn’t get that. For him, “if you like each other, go for it.” And I went along with it, but now I wish I hadn’t. Because the whole relationship felt like I was the one doing the convincing — of myself and of him.

I told him all of this. His response? “I’m sorry I hurt you… but I still don’t fully get it.”

And that’s when it really hit me. He probably never will. And maybe that’s why I was never fully expressive with him — deep down, I didn’t feel safe to be. Because I didn’t feel chosen, I didn’t feel seen. I felt like I was just there, and he thought that was enough.

I don’t hate him. I know he tried — but it wasn’t in a way that made me feel loved. It made me feel alone. So I left.

But now I’m here wondering: was I wrong for expecting more effort from someone who says he loves me? Is it wrong that “time” wasn’t enough for me? Was I asking for too much?",29,32,2025-06-28 02:44:12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmc7m7/i_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend_he_loved_me_but_it/,,,"You know the saying, actions speak louder than words. One big sign of emotional health is how much investment they are putting into the relationship. Are they giving you time, energy and effort? These are the bare minimums, or at least to try. Love is a complicated thing. Some people grow only to expect and receive love, but not give. As a guy, men are often like this.  Would you want him to be your husband? What if you got into a car accident? How would he take care of your kids? Hopefully he will mature and he will realize. You guys are different.

You have every right to ask for certain needs to be met. And you have every right to break up with him if he fails to make the changes necessary to meet those needs.  However......I wouldn't assume that his lack of change was due to a lack of ""effort"" (your word). I think it's entirely possible that he's simply unable to change (not without years of therapy, at least). His traits may be hard-wired into his personality, and asking him to change those traits would be like asking you to NOT want all the things that you wanted.  Basically, you both have deeply-rooted love-languages which conflicted with each other. So, your binary choice is to either accept and tolerate the differences.....or break up. ||| You may find the grass isn't always greener. ||| Your feeling are valid. Love by itself is not enough.

Here are some harsh truths that helped me to think it through: (1) someone doing their best may not be “enough” or right for you and (2) just ask yourself, is the way that you felt in the relationship something that you would be happy feeling for the rest of your life? ||| Hello OP.  I was in a similar boat in my recent relationship of 3.5 years. I felt like over the last six months or so, it became gradually more noticeable of my ex being more checked out and me feeling like he was relying on me to carry the relationship and nurturing it. He kept saying he loves me but his lack of effort and initiative in making plans and communication were a continuing problem.  We were supposed to be moving in together this August, and he had already applied for the apartment. However, I noticed that he stopped initiating plans and communication with me. I also felt like he stopped showing interest in whatever was going on in my life. His mom told me she had even asked him if he loved me, and his response was yes he does. He just seemed very checked out, in general, about life unless it involved sports or  drinking with his coworkers and friends.  I also do believe he did love me, but somewhere along the lines, he moreso loved the idea of me but wasn’t willing to prioritize us or break any bad habits/old ways for us. Anyways, one day I called him because I was struggling with some stuff going on at my workplace. He ignored my phone call and didn’t even bother acknowledging my feelings and said he was out for a couple brews. We ended up getting into an argument over texting, but he had opened up the path for us to break up a couple times during that conversation. At one point, he said he loved me but was tired at this point. So I told him over text that if he was tired and knew that he wasn’t gonna try anymore, he should tell me now and we would end it. Ultimately, he made that decision to me over text. This happened a few weeks ago by the way.  I don’t know who you are and I don’t know what your relationship was like, but I think you deserve someone who is already physically, emotionally, and mentally there. I met my ex when he was 25, and he certainly had put in a lot more effort into our relationship, but after a couple years, things start we to slowly change over time. I think a lot of that had to do with my ex’s insecurities, lack of life experience,  and still living with his folks. I think his living situation enabled him to be unhappy but comfortable living at home, without any motivation or drive to progress or be open to change. Now, he is about to be 29, and there just has not been a lot of growth on his part in his career and life. I still love him very much, but now I know as a 33F that I deserve more in a man and realize from my past  relationship that I have so much to offer and deserve someone who is able and wanting to reciprocate that effort.  I am rooting for us in life and love. Keep your head up. You are strong and resilient."

"After a year of silence, something just happened today. Would love your take after hearing my story.","
It’s been almost a year since the breakup, and after everything I’ve gone through, I just need to share my story, and ask for your perspective on something that just happened.

I was in a relationship where I gave 100% of myself: emotionally, financially, mentally. I supported her when she had no one: paid for groceries, tuition, rent, took care of her lifestyle, and stood by her during her lowest moments. I never expected anything in return, just loyalty and love.

I was completely blindsided when she dumped me; no warning, no conversation, no explanation. Just gone. Left me on the floor crying, begging for her not to walk away. And even then, I didn’t know the reality.

It wasn’t until later that her roommate told me things that opened my eyes and the closure my soul needed to stop sabotaging myself further as my love was genuine and real unlike her. So, she had been talking about me behind my back during the relationship: “He’s rich, he’ll pay,” and “Don’t worry, he’ll forget if you don’t pay him. He’ll cover everything, he always does,” “He has a better lifestyle, so I’ll just take that.” That broke me in million pieces cz I never looked at her that way. I was used. I was a convenience, lastly I was betrayed. I don’t understand how she moved on within the same week, no grieve; filling the void of me with other guys and sleeping with them while I was left in pieces, sabotaging, trying to find my soul.

I took therapy, not because I was weak, but because I wanted to find myself again, to heal and reconnect with my pure soul: not just for my own peace, but so that one day, when I date or love again, I’m healthy enough not to project my past pain onto someone else’s daughter.

Unlike my damaged ex who is stepping into other people’s life to fill that void and break them in pieces without fixing herself. Thought I could save her or fix her. Then my best friend told me, this song is made for you dawg: No Role Modelz - J. Cole

My therapist later explained that people like her often show signs of covert narcissism or emotionally avoidant behavior, they feed off others, lack empathy, and discard people when they’re no longer needed. That hit hard, but it helped me let go. I was ready to take bullets for her, and she turned out to be the one pulling the trigger. I realized that people like that don’t love, they damage.

Over the past year, I’ve rebuilt myself, therapy, self-reflection, setting boundaries, and finally learning my self-worth. I’ve gone through hell and back, but I made it. And I promised myself I would never let someone treat me like that again.

After a full year of silence, she suddenly texted me:

“Hey my name, I know you might not respond, but I just wanted to check in , I hope everything’s alright back home. And to make sure you’re doing okay too”

I’m not responding, because I’ve healed, and I won’t reopen a chapter that nearly destroyed me. But I am curious:

What does a message like this usually mean?

* Is it guilt trip?
* A realization of what she lost that was once real love she never had?
* Or is it just fishing for a reaction to see if I’m still reachable?
* Or she’s being real?
* Do I still hear her thoughts if we ever cross paths again, (we live on the same street but haven’t once since the breakup; god’s plan), now that I have the power to stay detached/moved on and see the mask behind the face?

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from anyone who’s dealt with exes more or less like this. Thank you for reading this long, means lot, and much love 🙏

Just closing off by saying I will not reply and I will move on with my current life, because I truly deserve better.

It doesn’t matter what it means. Focusing on figuring that out if just letting her take more of your time and peace. Will the reason why change how you respond or react? No. Either way you aren’t responding. So it doesn’t matter. Her motives are hers to figure out, not yours. ||| How long was the relationship ?? People like her use others, and it's only much later down the road that they realize what they have given up on. But make no mistake, if you go back to her, she will do the same thing she initially did. These people take us for granted, and will abuse the love and care we provide. I went back to an ex once who cheated on me, when I had done literally everything for him, and it didn't go too well. He didn't cheat again, but he did other shitty stuff and never truly appreciated me. So yeah, they will miss how well you treated them but the moment you go back, they will abuse you again. ||| probably number 3 mixed with avoidance, a bit feeling sorry for what she wasted, but all under chill tone. your therapist could be well right about her, feeding off the vulnerable people.  just stay away. you did a good job for your mental health. hope you find what you deserve soon ❤️ ||| she is testing the waters. you did right by not responding. she sounds manipulative. ||| What a despicable human being!!

I could see him saying the same about me, tbh. But he’d be wrong. I don’t know if I thought the same if I’d be wrong? His departure has inspired a crumbling of what I thought, what I feared, and what is rational.   I guess that’s my problem. He’s only wanted me on his terms—no middle ground.   I was just done the same way tbh. I gave him everything… all I had to give and it wasn’t enough to try let alone stay.   What worries me is that in this story you’ve told, I fed his delusions of taking care of me, of being all there was for me, was everything I needed or wanted.  The truth is we weren’t perfect but I thought it was normal. I thought it was ok if I cried myself to sleep beside him. I had to ask him to comfort me?  But I still know he’s capable of more. He just happened to become my favorite person. He wants friendship. I can’t give him the echo of what we had because for me, it was an intimate friendship that I thought neither of us experienced. I’m trying but I cry every day. But I still do that anyway so what the fuck   He never tried. I never mattered enough to try for different. Or say his actual thoughts. It was easier to run.

As a woman, I’ve only reached out to exes that I’m still interested in, BUT she sounds like she was using you which is why I say 3. ||| Don’t reply! She took advantage of you and what you had!

I learned to put limits and to respect them and love myself first and now I know what I want and I would never settle for any less and never will tolerate anything that I don’t deserve!!!  Keep it going! One day you will find someone who appreciates and love you the way you love them!! ||| Fishing for a reaction for sure. If she felt guilty and wanted you back, she would have done more than just dropping those few meaningless lines. To respond or not is really up to you. I was blindsided with a breakup by my ex after 7 years. Everyone told me he wasn’t good for me and that I shouldn’t talk to him any more. If I had quit cold turkey, my withdrawal symptoms could have gotten worse. I decided to meet him a few times after, allowed him to speak his mind and all I discovered was nothing, but selfishness and that numbed me and made me lose love. Did it hurt? Absolutely, but it also opened my eyes to a certain degree. What I’m saying is you need to find your own kind of closure and sometimes that means to see them one more time in person to see them for who they really are clearly."
Breakup got me so fucked up Im about to go on a night walk without my phone lol,Just officially broke it off about 2 hours ago.

The first few hours after a breakup hit the hardest, everything feels unreal, your heart is racing, and your mind is all over the place. That mix of heartbreak and adrenaline can make you want to run, disappear, or just do something to escape the pain. I get it. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. You’re human, and this kind of loss cuts deep.  If you’re heading out on a night walk, please take care of yourself. Bring your phone if you can, not because anyone expects you to talk, but just for safety. This moment feels like the end of something huge, and it is. But it's also the beginning of something else, a version of you that’s going to grow through this, even if right now that feels impossible.  You said something powerful: *'I know I’ll come out stronger and better*.' That mindset, even in the middle of your pain, is your anchor. Hold onto that. You don't need to have all the answers tonight. Just breathe. Drink some water. Get through this hour. That’s the only goal right now. You don’t need to be strong yet; you just need to keep going.  When it hurts too much, remind yourself: “*You’re not alone*”. This pain won’t last forever. Bit by bit, day by day, you’ll start to rebuild, not just your heart, but your peace. One night at a time, and this summer it might start with heartbreak, but it can still end in healing. You’ve got this!!!  Sending you a warm hug!  R.

Only thing i can tell is don't ignore your feelings and come out stronger than ever! ||| good   leave the phone, leave the distractions, and just *feel*   walk until you stop wanting to turn around, not just physically but emotionally   let the weight of the breakup ground you so you can start stepping away from it  the next few weeks will suck, but that’s how the reset happens   you won’t heal by avoiding it, but by living through it  be your own peace for a while   you’re gonna come back to this stronger—just not tomorrow   one step at a time ||| Lmao"
Burnout Breakups and Mixed Signals,"He broke up with me 6 weeks ago. We both got burnt out, he is avoidant and I’m anxious so it showed up in different ways. The first 2-2.5 years of our almost 6 year relationship were amazing. Then it slowly started to fall apart with the last 2 years being very on and off in terms of affection and our general happiness. He has a porn addiction that spiraled into affecting my self esteem and my mental health, which then made his avoidance and porn addiction worse.

We really tried, literally just a few weeks before he broke up with me we had a discussion about his porn addiction and he had said he could see and wanted a future with me still. But the burnout was too strong and neither of us had the energy or knowledge on how to fix the relationship in meaningful ways. He said he loves me like a friend still, and that he had to turn off his love for me so he could initiate the break up.

It’s weird and confusing for me, because he’s currently acting warm and is offering me updates on his daily life. He bought me a couple of drinks that he was having a hard time finding, was all excited saying “look what I fooouund”. He asked how my tattoo was heading and showed me the one he got yesterday. Just overall more than someone typically is when interacting with the person they recently broke up with.

When I asked if he’d consider taking a break right after the breakup he said he wouldn’t consider dating me again for at least 5 years. I asked him a week later why that hard limit, long time frame and he said he simply likes multiples of 5 and so it sounded like a good number to say. A week after that we talked and I brought up the hypothetical of if he does start to have regrets since turning love off doesn’t always last forever, and he said that he already decided that he made his bed and had to lie in it, so he has to deal with the consequences even if it hurts him. I said he didn’t need to keep walls up if our friendship seems to be leading to dating again, and he said he would keep that in mind.

I now know that this breakup was necessary so we can heal ourselves without having to worry about healing a relationship at the same time. I just hope that once we heal that we both will want to try again, but with the ability to properly support a relationship.

He moves out in a bit over a week. I’m sad but I think no contact for a hit will be good for us, especially with his current extra warm behaviour than a dumper typically would be showing.",1,2,2025-06-28 20:36:37,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmwq3v/burnout_breakups_and_mixed_signals/,,,5 years? Good lord.
May 4th,"What I did on May 4th wasn’t okay. I crossed a line. I was angry, humiliated, heartbroken, and pushed past my limit and I snapped. I wasn’t thinking about right or wrong. I was thinking about making her feel even a fraction of what she made me feel. I wanted her to feel exposed, embarrassed, and stripped of control because that’s exactly how she left me: discarded, accused, silenced, and erased. She got to walk away clean, spinning the story in her favor while I was still sitting in the wreckage wondering what the hell just happened.But I see it clearly now. That moment didn’t come from strength. It came from pain I didn’t know how to carry. And that pain turned me into someone I don’t want to be again. I’m not proud of how I handled it but I also refuse to hate myself for reacting like a human being who was deeply hurt. I don’t owe her anything. Not forgiveness. Not contact. Not peace. But I owe myself something. I owe myself the choice to stop letting her pull me back into her story. I don’t need to fight for truth anymore. I just need to live in it.What happened was ugly but it wasn’t senseless. It came from betrayal abandonment and manipulation and I reacted. That version of me doesn’t need to be erased. He needs to be understood. And now that I’ve faced him I know better. I won’t lose myself like that again. She doesn’t get to define me by my lowest moment. Do I regret it? No I don't. Because a part of me hopes that she felt even a fraction of the pain she made me feel.

Advice From a Man Who Lived It,"To every man out there
Every guy who’s lucky enough to fall in love, truly and deeply, Listen to me.

If you’ve ever looked at her and knew she was the one…
If you felt that burning certainty in your chest,
that voice in your soul that said, “I’d give everything for her,”
Pause.
Breathe.
And be honest with yourself first.

Because love…
Real love…
Isn’t just about feelings.
It’s about readiness.
Emotional. Mental. Financial.

These aren’t just words.
These are the foundations of what it means to be a man.

You are the man.
You are her protector—her safe space.
You are the provider—not just of money, but of peace, of security, of trust.

And let’s not forget: God created us as men to face the world.
He gave us the strength—physical strength to build, to carry, to lead…
To build the world and rebuild it again if needed.

But He didn’t stop there.
He gave us the mental strength to carry responsibility—to protect, to lead, to guide.
To carry our families on our shoulders with faith, with wisdom, with purpose.

So if you’re not ready—
If you’re still figuring yourself out,
If your heart is full of chaos,
If your pockets are empty and your mind is unsure—
Tell her.
Don’t hold her hand with one foot out the door.
Don’t let her build castles in the sky while your foundation is still sand.
Don’t use her love as a comfort zone while you search for direction.

Because the moment she realizes she’s building alone,
The moment she stops feeling safe in your arms,
You’ll lose her.

And that kind of loss…
It doesn’t just break your heart.
It breaks you.

I know.
Because I lived it.

I had the kind of love most people spend their whole lives searching for.
She wasn’t just a chapter.
She was the whole book.

And I ruined it—not because I didn’t love her,
But because I wasn’t ready to carry the love I’d found.
I was too fast.
Too caught up in the rush.
In the excitement.
In the fire.

But fire burns when you don’t know how to hold it.
And I burned her…
And I burned myself in the process.

So hear me, man to man:
Don’t enter a love like that unless you’re ready to honor it.
To fight for it.
To protect it with everything you are.

Because if you lose a woman like that—
A woman who truly believed in you,
Who gave you her soul with open hands—
You don’t just lose her.
You lose the best version of yourself that existed when she loved you.

And that…
Is a loss you will feel for a lifetime.

Breaking up with someone is worse than being broken up with,"I broke up with my boyfriend this week, and it was absolutely horrible. I knew I had to do it because we just aren’t compatible in that way. I still love him and want him in my life, just not in a romantic way. And of course, now my brain is stuck on all of the good memories and trying to convince me that I made a mistake. I know I didn’t, but it’s still awful to feel that way. I think it’s easier to be broken up with because it’s not your choice. You don’t have to wonder if you made a mistake and shouldn’t have done it. You don’t have to cause someone so much pain. Our breakup conversation broke something inside of me. He is still my best friend, and it’s killing me to not text him about my day. I do really miss him and this causes me to fear I made a mistake.

"He left after 7 years, not sure how to navigate this…","My partner of almost 7 years left yesterday. He got off the plane in my city at 10PM, and walked away down my street at 2AM, without looking back after a final hug.

About our story :
He was my first love.
We met at university, in his country (I live about 5 hours door-to-door from him in Europe), and lived together for 2 years alternating between our respective flats.

We didn’t see each other for a few months during Covid and reunited after graduation when I moved back to his country to try and find a job there.
It didn’t work out so I took it as a gap year to do a few internships, while I lived with a relative and then with him at his parents’ house. So another year of living together-ish.

I moved back home to pursue a Master’s degree as it offered better early career opportunities than I would have found in his country. It was meant to be temporary and I found a job at an international company with offices in his country so I’d be able to move there eventually if that was what we agreed upon.

I always said that I’d love for him to try and come to my country and learn the language, at least to be able to share cultural references and engage with older members of my family. Unfortunately, he found it hard and was very caught up with work (his job is intense with nights shifts and over the last year and a half he was also studying part time towards a qualification).

We always tried to meet at least once a month for 3-4 days if not more, and make it as even as possible since I'd moved back home.
As he got busier with work and studies (he sometimes wouldn’t be able to call for a few days and barely text due to his shifts and the stress generated by work - I was still the person he engaged with the most), my ego got the best of me and I would push back on visiting as I felt it was imbalanced.
I now deeply regret it.

I also deeply regret criticising his country and stating over and over how we’d be better off in mine.
I regret arguing with him over closing the gap and making life plans, as he was always a ‘live day-by-day’ person.
I feel like I didn’t give enough of a shot at living there considering I was the one who spoke the language and had the qualifications to work there.

I thought he was my forever person, and never connected that way with anyone else.
He was my best friend, made me feel safe and understood, made me laugh and feel loved. Now I can’t help but wonder how he’s doing, what he’s up to, if he still thinks of us and misses me, if he too is crying in his room as I am.

He was such a great person, friend, partner, lover. I don’t want to resent him or forget him but I feel like I’ll never be able to get over him and be stuck thinking I sabotaged it.

He said he’d made his decision, that we tried and I had done nothing wrong.
That unfortunately he most likely won’t come back and we’d grown apart. That we had different goals. That he felt he was dragging me along and if anything I’d done too well.

I can’t let go of the hope he’ll reach out, that hurts a lot. And I feel like if I did reach out, in weeks or months, he’d find me pathetic and would’ve already moved on. Or simply find me annoying or pity me.

I can’t believe he’d think life would be better without me in it, even though to the last day we spent together he’d said I was a fantastic partner and it was a success, not a failure. That he loved me but not the same as before.

I don’t know how to navigate this. I’m aware if we ever tried again it’d be a different relationship and we’d have to get to know each other again, but I would still take him back in a heartbeat.

I’m replaying our memories, happy and sad, over and over in my head. I can’t believe it’s over.

I guess I’m just here to vent and bleed my heart out…

Breaking up after an 8 year relationship. 33 and moving out on my own for the very first time.,"Me and my boyfriend of 8 years are currently going through a breakup. We still live together and sleep in the same bed when we have to because it’s the only bed, but put up a divider of pillows between us.

I’ve been looking for a place to move out on my own (and waiting to hear back from one that I LOVE! 
🤞🤞) 
and this will be the first time I’ve EVER lived alone. I’ve always lived with family, or significant others.
Even when I was 15, I had a boyfriend that got kicked out of his place and my mom let him live with us for almost a year.
One day when I was about 19, my mom kicked me out of the house, so I went to my boyfriend at the time’s house and lived with him for like 2 years. 
After that breakup ended, I came back home for a few months, and then that’s when I met my bf that we are talking about now. we are splitting up after 8 years.
I moved in just a few months within the relationship and have lived in 3 different houses with him since.

It’s hard because not only am I going to miss the type of relationship we had together, how well he knew me, just how comfortable we were with eachother, knowing each others sense of humor, knowing the worst parts of me but accepting them anyway, etc. it’s so hard. But I know we are not right for eachother and that it’s the right thing for both of us. We also have dogs together so that’s what makes it so difficult, too. 

But the other thing that I’m also trying to navigate through is moving out solely on my own for the very first time. I’m kind of excited, kind of nervous, scared for when I will get lonely, afraid if I run into any problems that I don’t have back up for in the next room, etc.

What do you think of this message I want to send to my ex after being repeatedly ignored,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to ask for your thoughts on a message I'm planning to send to my ex girlfriend(20). 
We've been in this weird on and off contact since she reached out to me a lot of times, but whenever I reply she begins to ignore me after 15-20 days. This cycle has been going on for almost two years.

Now, I think she might be talking to someone new again, and I'm tired of being strung along or treated like a backup. I've been patient enough because of my love for her, but this time I just want to walk away with some dignity.

Here's the message I want to send:

""""""""""""""""

Good evening *****,

I assume you're talking to someone else now. Sorry if it's wrong of me to text you, but I'm honestly tired of being ignored. From now on, let's just move on with our lives as if we never met.

I wish you happiness always. Take care

""""""""""""""

Do you think this message is okay to send? Is it too harsh, too soft, or fair enough? 

I'd really appreciate any suggestions or similar experiences :)",1,5,2025-06-28 20:07:33,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmw2ut/what_do_you_think_of_this_message_i_want_to_send/,,,"Thats a call for attention.  No one sked you, so no one needs explanations. ||| Honestly… I would just block her. That might sound harsh but trust me that it would be the most clean way to end it. I always want to do the last message thing but in some way or another it’s very likely or possible that you want to send that because you want to get something back from her not because you truly want finality, or at least it was the case for me.  Altogether, a person like this is likely not going to do anything to help you move on. I was given this same advice and at the time was very resistant to it so I could understand if you are also. I loved my ex gf and understood her in a way that I felt like I couldn’t fault her or hold her accountable to things she did similar to what you’re describing. And the truth is it would have been so much better for both of us if I had just completely moved on.  If you send another message, you might think it’s a goodbye of some sort but it sounds like you both have said goodbye multiple times. I think now it’s time to just leave and to close the door to her saying “hello” again. Since that relationship, I’ve dated a couple other people and blocked them when it didn’t work out and it’s honestly so freeing because I never have to think about whether they will text me back or reciprocate or anything, and I can just go about my life and truly as though I never met them like you say in your message ||| Honestly, the texting won’t do anything. The behavior will continue. At this point, I would completely move on. I’ve wasted a lot of years of my life entertaining these exact situations, and more than anything I just wish I could turn back time and walk away sooner."
I’m tempted to text him.,"I know he’s probably sick of me at this point. We broke up back in march, and he met someone new after a month of being broken up. They’re still talking and hanging out to this day, and he already introduced her to his family. At this point i’m cooked. We were supposed to go to colorado in october and Florida in september. We still have each other on social media and he thinks we’re “friends”. I noticed he still watches my stories and will rewatch stories that have pictures of me. I have a feeling he’s still attracted me but might be confused on how he truly feels. He still hasn’t posted her on his social media to let the world know. I’m so tempted to want to text him to meet up and talk honestly and fix things. I tried doing this attempt in May and he was very certain on not wanting to get back together because he was talking to someone and told me hes “having a great time getting to know her”. In a perfect world, I’d meet up with him, we’d have a long conversation about everything, fix things, and everything would go back to normal.

Will my ex ever come back?,"My 10-year boyfriend with whom I was living together for four years went for shopping and never came back. I live on the east coast and he was taken by his family to the west coast and they have made him cut off all contact with me. I am broken to a million pieces. He promised to marry me some day, cared so much for me and now he just left me when I needed him the most. I can’t believe he just broke the lease and left like I meant nothing to him. I feel like death is the only thing that can end my pain. It’s been a month but everyday has been a battle. He was my whole world and I didn’t have a life without him. That’s why I’m suffering every minute. My whole world has collapsed and I don’t know how much longer I can bear this endless pain.

Fiancée’s Mom Is Too Involved in Our Relationship And I Want To End It,"The title says it all.
I’m struggling with how involved my fiancée’s mom is in our relationship—she constantly crosses boundaries that make me uncomfortable. I’ve tried expressing this to my fiancée, but I’m usually met with, “That’s just how she is.” She and her mom share a lot of the same traits—controlling tendencies, manipulation, and a level of clinginess that feels overwhelming at times. Her mom has a very dominant presence—she carries a lot of masculine energy and tends to be controlling, abrasive, and manipulative. Lately, I’ve started to notice those same traits emerging in my fiancée, and it’s becoming hard to ignore.

Her mom has told me I don’t compliment her daughter enough. She’s made inappropriate comments, even calling me “hot.” She’s texted me more than once to say I need to validate her daughter more—ironically, I already do that multiple times a day. I’ll tell my fiancée she looks beautiful, and her mom will chime in with something like, “No, you need to say she looks hot. ‘Beautiful’ doesn’t always affirm her the way we want to feel.”

I’m genuinely trying my best in this relationship, but this dynamic with her family is starting to weigh on me. I’m not sure I can see myself marrying into this.

Officially day 1 of the breakup.,"He (27m) broke things off again with me (30f) last night after work. We were together 5+ years and engaged. I had tried, so so hard, to fix things since the start of this year. I really did give this relationship my all and I don't know how I'm ever going to trust and love another person ever again. I feel so sick. This first day is so hard. We live together and I'm going to the leasing office on Monday to see when we can break the lease, since our apartment is through October. 

I'm in love with him but hes not in love with me anymore. It hurts not being able to hug him goodbye as he goes to work. I can't help but think of how handsome and lovely he is, even during our conversation last night. He was my rock. I still wanted a future with him. Crying as I'm typing this. I'm trying so hard to find the strength to get through my day. I really wish he would have fought for me as hard as I fought for him. I even turned down other men recently for him, I still can't even imagine betraying him for someone new.

Why did things have to turn out like this :(  I feel beyond broken. I'm never enough 

Edit: we've broken up and gotten back together 3 times since this year (never had problems before so I wanted to try to save us) but after our conversation last night, and how he wanted emotional space, I broke us up. I really didn't want to. But as hard as it is I'm going to try to stick through it this time.

Broke up almost a year ago; I'm unsure where my heart stands,"I’ve been hesitant to share this as I don't typically share things like this here... It’s personal, and still tangled up in emotion. But it’s been sitting heavy on my chest. I’m not looking for judgment, just honest insight from anyone who’s maybe been through something similar or can offer a clear perspective.

**TLDR;** Together for just over 8 years, broke up in mid 2024 due to lack of intimacy, relationship imbalance, and no forward movement (no engagement, kids, or moving out of our bad apartment). Still love him deeply and we remain close friends, we see each other often. I’m wondering if it’s worth trying again or if I’m just clinging to what’s familiar. Looking for genuine advice, not judgment.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
I’m 29 (F), and I was with my ex (M, also 29) from November 2015 until I ended things in July 2024. Almost a decade together. I broke it off for reasons I’ll explain below but now, nearly a year later, I’m still conflicted. I told him I didn’t want to get back together, and I believed it. But recently… I’m not so sure I meant it fully.

People keep asking if we’re back together or heading that way. I just laugh and shrug it off but deep down, I don’t really know how to answer that.

We’ve stayed friends since the breakup. We still see each other several times a week; errands, small hangouts, life stuff. Our friend groups are small and quiet, and honestly, there’s a comfort in him that’s hard to shake. He was my best friend. He still kind of is. How do you fully let go of someone who was in your whole twenties?

I’m not going to lay out every detail of our relationship because I don’t want this to feel like an attack piece on either of us; just a real moment, with the key things that led to the end:

**Intimacy** – There was hardly any. At one point, we were only having sex maybe once a year if that. I’d try to initiate, ask, plead... and still nothing. Eventually I stopped trying altogether. That kind of distance hurts, and even though I know sex isn’t everything, for me it’s a necessary form of connection. I felt rejected and unwanted.

**Laziness** – We lived together, and I carried the bulk of it. The home, our two cats, the little life we shared; it all fell on me. I know I wanted to be a homemaker one day, but not like this. Not when it felt like I was the only one putting in the effort. He acknowledges that he got lazy. I’d ask for help, and he’d do things late or half-heartedly. That constant imbalance chipped away at me until I felt numb.

**Stagnation** – There was no real growth. I’ve always been upfront that I wanted to eventually get married and have kids. I also hated the apartment we were in, it was run down, and I begged to move but he always wanted to stay or gave me little to nothing when I showed new places. I felt like we were stuck, and I was the only one trying to move us forward.

I still love him. Deeply. Despite those big things.

But I can’t forget the things that broke me. Like finding open tabs of porn on his computer; not the content itself, but the *context.* We had no intimacy, no physical closeness, and he was still finding release elsewhere. Meanwhile, I wasn’t even taking care of my own needs. It made me feel like a ghost in my own relationship.

There was also jealousy around my male friends. I understand his insecurities, but I’ve always had mostly guy friends as I was a tomboy growing up. That’s just my social circle. And still, my loyalty never wavered.

But now, after exploring a bit of dating, I find myself thinking about the past. No one else feels like him. He saw all of me… the weird, soft, sharp edged parts and never judged. He supported me in everything I did. He always believed in me. And that kind of acceptance is rare.

We had real issues, and I’m not blind to my own flaws either. But I’m wondering... is it worth having a serious conversation? Is there even a chance to rebuild something new from the ruins of what we had? Or am I just being nostalgic, missing a comfort that feels safe, even if it wasn’t always good?

Before anyone jumps on me about the sex thing; yes, I know relationships aren’t all about that. And we *did* have soft, sweet moments without it… cuddles, gentle affection, emotional connection. I cherished all of that. But I also need touch. I need kisses, hugs, closeness. I need to feel wanted.

So yeah... this is where I’m at. Torn between memory and reality, love and logic. What would you do?

Ex told me I am too skinny,While me and my ex were together he constantly reminded me of how skinny I was and how that was unattractive to him.

I don't even know anymore,"So me and my ex, we were together 8 years, split up end of March, she broke up with me. But we have still been living together since. I will move out in a few days. We don't have any fights or something, just normal.

She already went on a date and me also. She said her date wasn't succesfull, but mine was, in a way. There was a period my ex stayed with her parents and I was alone myself in the house. That is when my date came over. And yes, she stayed the night.

Today, me and my ex were cleaning up stuff I had to take with me and she found that girl earings in my bedroom. I didn't even know they were still there. My ex wasn't mad, she just putted them in front of me and told her I should give them back. After a few minutes she was laughing with it, because she knows the girl. She even said she was happy for me.

But I must admit, suddenly, I feel horrible as fck. I don't even know what to feel right now or think. It has been the second time in all that period we were split up, tears coming to my eyes.

Secondly it seems like you want her to miss you or get jealous but instead she acted perfectly okay with you seeing others and that may be what's getting to you.  As a female I can say that a part of her probably has gotten upset about finding earrings of another girl but she cares enough about you to not make you feel bad about it. Most likely because she was the one to end the relationship so doesn't feel like she has a right to be visibly upset. Hope I'm making sense.   You could also be getting upset because this moment cements the breakup more. Sadly you'll have a few more of these moments but I promise it gets easier.

Im back again (honestly think this is just a brain dump lol I haven't talked to people in a hot minute),Been a hot minute since I last vented or posted but man even healing and doing good you'll have bad days i guess. Currently going through some depression stuff been having a hard time messaging people cause I legit just wanna go into sweater town and not come out again lol. 😅 friends keep checking on me and I'll send memes in response to show im still alive but I've been enjoying my solitude its been harder for me to recharge. I guess I can start with some stuff I've learned in the past 9 months of my break up. The stuff that I used to love but suddenly hated yeah apparently everyone gets like that. I associated my memories of doing all those things with him and I learned the best way to find yourself again is make new memories with the things you loved doing. Rediscovering my passions that felt like they left when he left. It's been interesting. I still can't watch Gilmore Girls without bawling my eyes out (I was literally dumped while in the middle of an episode) but ive been watching still working at it till i regain that piece of myself. I used to love going on adventures before i dated my ex he was a homebody so he never wanted to go with me. I just went to the creek for the first time in 2 years and it was awesome. But suddenly im just feeling gross mentally again. Im trying to keep up that upbeat attitude but sometimes I like crying and mourning mu relationship I thought I had with him. I miss him. And still feel empty but im working hard to find myself again.

"Spiraled and spam called ex at 5am, don't be me","For context, dated for 8 months, she fell in love first, I fell in love too. She would say how I was perfect and how I was everything she ever wanted. She said that when were together I gave her so much energy. It was perfect.

She then wanted to join the navy, I supported this as any good bf would, but then she started to act all distant from me, not messaging or calling as much so I asked her what was up and she eventually said she wanted to break up because she didn't want to be in a relationship while in the navy and also didn't want to regret not 'having more fun' while she is still young, she's 25 and I'm 29 btw. 

So I was really upset and thought we could hook up casually until she left. From the break up convo I did NOT cope well, constantly looking at her socials, messaging her, we talked a little for about 10 days until I CRASHED OUT 

My sleeping has been all fucked up and I keep waking up at 4:30am. I downloaded Hinge, this is where we both met, and guess who I find, yip it was her. She had in her profile that her ideal Sunday was 'food, gym, bang' and that she wanted casual fun. I was on there too so can't really throw stones. So I went crazy, messaged her saying 'why cant we bang and gym a couple more times before you leave'. Then I let the demons get the better of me so I called, she declined, I called again, she declined and then I called again. Until eventually she said that it's because of the way I've been acting and that I should respect her choice. 

DONT BE ME. Probably the most embarrassing thing I have done. If you get dumped DO NOT BE ME, DO NOT CALL OR MESSAGE, especially at 5am. Get used to the fact they will be getting with other people almost immediately after the break up and really focus on your own life.

I've definitely ruined any chance of seeing/sleeping with her again so if that is something you are entertaining, DO NOT BE ME. Even if you are just trying to move on. DO NOT BE ME. Telling this story to help you feel better if you are in no contact as this is a prime example of breaking that rule only to look desperate, pathetic and only drive them further away.

Like for a second the crazyness slowed down when she was around.You told yourself yeah this is it. This is who I want. You saw a future in her. She became part of your purpose without even trying. Being with her made you feel like you were finally doing something right.And when it ended it wasn’t just a breakup. It felt like your identity cracked. You start asking yourself was any of it real Did she ever feel the same Was I just convenientYou don’t just miss her. You miss the version of you that only existed with her. That softer part. That hopeful part. That version that thought love could actually work this time.But now she’s gone. Acts like none of it mattered. And you’re left with all the pieces trying to rebuild something out of what’s left. No closure. No answers and memories that won’t let go.

Question or something idk,"So my ex about 8ish months ago ended our engagement (relationship all together) very abruptly. I am not kidding in that we never fought, went on trips together (even did one a week before she ended it) that always went great even the last one. When she ended she said she wasn’t sure why or what caused the change but just she doesn’t see me as her person anymore.  We remained on good terms even talked regularly. I don’t want to be friends only in a relationship with her and let her know at breakup. She continues to keep all of our pictures up including dates, anniversary and even engagement pics and also on her public profile a pic of me and her saying so thankful for this guy!

Anyway so like I said we were talking then all of a sudden she stopped responding (no texts were deep or emotional) so I stopped sending. After about a week or so of me not sending anything she texted me saying sorry and wasn’t trying to ignore me just didn’t know what to say (like I said none were deep so that was confusing) and I responded with it’s okay I understand and thanks for reaching out.  Then about two weeks after that she sent me a TikTok saying this “You never know the amount of love you have inside you to give and receive till the day you launch cause you are leaving all that love behind and you’re surrendering and you’re hoping you get another chance to love them again. And so when you come back down you’re like oh I get another chance and I’m gonna do it!” Then a few days after she sent me one of someone singing you are my sunshine. I posted a story when norm from cheers died with him talking about love and she loved it…as I continue to live my life and not waiting for her but will always have space for her I’m just wondering what all that means?",1,0,2025-06-28 18:58:28,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmui26/question_or_something_idk/,,,

Surviving the first few days,"We were closing in on six months and I was trying to find a way to tell him I loved him. I’m in my mid 20s and I’ve never been in a relationship longer than a couple months. I’ve never been in love before. 

We had plans on his birthday and we broke up the day before. He said he just didn’t feel the same way anymore. That it wasn’t anything I had done. I had no idea he was feeling that way (He had been for a couple weeks I guess, I just wish he had said something about it.) I can’t even find it within myself to be angry. I’m just devastated. 

I thought he was the one. How do I start to move on when everything feels so…. wrong now?

I am cycling between feeling like I’m going to throw up, like I’m going to die, and being unable to do anything other than cry. 

I keep finding myself hoping that he will change his mind. But then I’ve just started thinking that he probably felt relieved and like a weight off of his chest to finally dump me and now I just feel empty and sad and broken. 

How do I make it through these first few days? I know that I will survive but it doesn’t feel like it right now.

I feel betrayed when I need to. I just have faith that the intensity of the emotions will eventually go away.  The free time you get after a break up is rather scary. We used to call and text everyday. I've been using the free time as an opportunity to talk to and get closer with my friends and family! I ring and text my friends, and I've been hanging out with my mum loads!  What I have also done is made a list of activities we used to do/places we used to go.

I'm with my family now but tonight will be home alone again and back to work. How am i supposed to just go through my days like normal? She was my first love and im so so scared I'll never love someone like that again. And even more scared that I'll never stop loving her and won't be able to get over her.

Any subreddits give you hope?,"I’m still going through the motions of my breakup. And I peruse through here often reading the stories and thoughts of people going through what I am in real time.

Nonetheless, I’m scared of what my future holds romantically and I’m sure you all are too.

As much I like knowing I’m not alone, I also want to have some type of hope that love will still come again and stay (despite that small (or big idk don’t judge me lol) part of my heart that wishes it was still with him). I’m sure many of you would like the reassurance too.

If you were the one heartbroken you are the person a good person is praying for.,"There are guys or people out there like me who want to commit to a woman or someone long-term and date with the intention of marriage. A committed, long-term partnership built on trust, respect, and genuine emotional intimacy. Like I don’t do hookups. Idk how to say this but personally, if I’m going to be dating someone, I’m going to be the person to choose her every day, no matter what  through the highs and lows, the easy mornings and the rough nights because to me, commitment isn’t just a word, it’s a promise. I believe that true love grows from a deep emotional bond, shared values, and mutual support.  Like If we’re in this together, she’ll have my wholehearted devotion, loyalty, and my promise to keep choosing her every day in and day out, no matter what comes our way.

he finally broke up with me but being with him was my only plan for the future… what now?,"i’m scared… i have BPD and i’m going through my first break up so i’m not dealing with it well. i’m also trying to go back to school at 19 after dropping out when i was 11 and it’s a big and scary change for me.

i’m still planning on moving to japan once i graduate and study at a japanese learning school but i only made those plans to be with my ex… now he’s gone and there’s nobody waiting for me there but i don’t know what else to do.

he promised me he’d save me from my abusive family, now he’s gone... he ghosted me after a year and a half. he said he was sorry but that he bit off more than he could chew and that he doesn’t think i can actually escape from here. where does this leave me? i’m trying but it’s so hard doing it all by myself.

most days i don’t see the point, i’m walking in a dark path and i don’t see the future. i don’t have anywhere i want to go and im doing it all by myself. i don’t have any friends to talk to or any real family, my ex was all i had and i was too much for him. i don’t know what to do or where to go anymore. nothing makes me happy.

what am i supposed to do? i miss him and i just need someone to hug me and hold my hand right now. i wish he was here to help me. i wish i still had my ex… i ruined everything. all i do now is cry and cry because i miss the first and only human connection ive ever had after being isolated for 8 years.

I think I screwed up my only chance to get my ex back,"Hello all! Wondering if there’s space for me here. I’m just spiraling after a Hail Mary attempt at getting an ex back. 

We officially broke up nearly a year ago, but it was messy and drawn out. I was dealing with a very serious life situation (can’t go into details) that made me feel like I couldn’t have a future with her, so I tried to end things. But she kept coming back, saying she wanted to fight for us. We went from exclusivity to being fwb which she was willing to settle for but I couldn’t keep doing it.  I felt like it was hurting her and I don’t like fwb situations but I didn’t know how to handle it. She wouldn’t let me go. I began emotionally withdrawing out of guilt and helplessness. Eventually, it ended with her feeling hurt and rejected, and me feeling like I pushed away the only person who really loved me. The last event was she was trying to schedule a trip together but that was too intimate for me so I tried to seem like I was busy but I gave her some conflicting answers, she called me out, I began getting defensive and she felt disrespected by what I said. 

She stopped messaging me and before I was gonna restart our typical loop of me apologizing and her thinking it means we’re back together, I thought why not have mercy on her and let her go. 

Months passed. I never stopped thinking about her. I figured out my situation. I missed her. I wanted to explain what had happened and how I’d changed. We hadn’t spoken in 6 months, except when I sent her a happy birthday message. I prob went too heavy cuz I sent her the Polaroid pic she gave on her birthday from last year and apologized for how things ended. She was surprisingly receptive said thanks and we chatted for a bit, she asked how I’ve been and then I made another mistake where I asked her to her to catch up over a birthday dinner a little too soon. Silence. 

After 3 days it was clear she wasn’t very interested and I crashed out and began over apologizing and explaining. She then responded 3 days after that saying she’s fine to listen and offer her opinions on things but she has a lot of stuff going on and doesn’t have the bandwidth to really help me with anything. I tried to scale back the seriousness and said I didn’t need help I just wanted to get her thoughts on some stuff and happy just get coffee  or a walk. 

4 days later, I caved and sent her a long, heartfelt message. I laid everything out. No pressure, just honesty, what I had gone through, how I felt, and that I still cared. I said if she ever wanted to talk, she could reach out. But I wouldn’t bother her again. It’s been over two days. No response. All this would have been better in person after we were on speaking terms but the fact that I couldn’t even get her to meet made me panic that this situation is hopeless cuz she prob still resents over the past and I thought I had to say something that might reframe how she might feel. This was so stupid. 

Now I’m spiraling.

I don’t know if she never saw the message (sent on a platform we talked on a lot but says message was delivered  ), or if she read it and just doesn’t care. I’m tortured by “what ifs.” I’m crushed. It hurts more than the breakup itself.

My questions:

1. What would have been a better way to reach out?

2. Is this situation totally hopeless now?
 
3. What’s really going on in her mind right now? I know nobody is a mind reader but if someone can help get some sort of bearing. My guess is she’s seeing someone so responding to me is not only difficult cuz I dumped a ton on her, it would be crossing a boundary with her current relationship. I’m only confused as to why she continued to talk to me, even pushing the convo forward at first.

4. Where do I go from here? No contact right?

Going through breakup with ex,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 26-year-old Muslim man, and she’s a 28-year-old Buddhist single mother of three. We got back together 6 months ago after 9 months of no contact. She was my first love, and I still love her deeply—even though she ghosted me the first time we broke up.

After we reconnected, I found out she’s a sex worker, which I didn’t know before. I accepted her even after knowing the truth because I understand she’s doing it to support her family. And deep down, I hoped that if my business succeeded, I could help her leave that life.

But now, she’s been sleeping with her ex and sometimes disappears for a day or two. She’s asking me to accept this because I can’t support her financially at the moment. It’s tearing me apart inside—I love her, but I don’t know what to do.

I’m also feeling very lost. I’m struggling with my business, I have nothing right now, and I feel completely alone. She’s constantly on my mind, and it’s affecting everything. I can’t focus, I can’t think straight—just stuck in this pain and confusion.

Any advice or thoughts would mean a lot.
",2,3,2025-06-28 14:36:51,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmobiz/going_through_breakup_with_ex/,,,"I am a Muslim too. My advice to you, brother, is that there are other girls who wish to meet you with your work, your money, and your personality. Just explore the world and explore others. She does not deserve you at all. Do not even think about it. She has someone else who pleases her, and you are running after her. This is a very bad thing, as if girls do not exist."
From ‘I want to build a life with you’ to ‘I’m not ready’ — trying to make sense of it,"Me(F,25) Him(M,25) We met 6 months ago through an online game. We quickly became close and added each other on social media. Back then, he was unemployed and struggling financially. I offered to help a few times, but he always said no. Even so, he opened up to me, shared a lot about his life, and even told his family about me. His mom joked about making sure I wasn’t a scammer, and his parents helped pay for the car rental on his first visit to see me. 

Before that trip, he got a job and thanked me for supporting him during hard times.  He brought me several gifts and, after that trip, we both agreed to be exclusive—no dating or sleeping with anyone else. 

That first visit was beautiful. But after he left, things started to shift. He said work was overwhelming and he didn’t have as much time, though he kept insisting his feelings hadn’t changed. But then, he mentioned a new friend—his best friend’s sister—and it became clear he was spending more of his free time with her. They went to the movies, cooked together, hung out often. Meanwhile, I kept asking for time, a call, or emotional connection, but I felt like I was no longer a priority. 

One incident really shook me. We had just agreed to notify each other of our plans out of respect. Then, the very next day, he disappeared in the evening—without saying anything. Turns out he had gone to the movies with her. I stayed up all night worrying. The next day he said he got home late and just passed out, not thinking it would be a big deal. That broke my trust. It hurt deeply, especially after our agreement. 

He said things like “I see a future with you” and “I still need you to design our house."" days before coming again. He came to visit me again this June. The week was intense, but he seemed emotionally distant—constantly on his phone, avoiding serious conversations. When I tried to talk about feelings, he’d say things like, “Only women like talking about that,” or call my questions silly. He claimed we didn’t need to force deep conversations, that we should just talk about whatever came naturally. But I felt dismissed. 

Eventually, I told him I felt disconnected. He admitted he felt it too but didn’t want to talk about it at that moment. Later, when we were alone, he opened up. He cried as he told me: 

“I’ve been feeling off for a while. I thought seeing you again would help, but it hasn’t. I’m not ready for the responsibilities of a relationship. I’ve been in relationships since I was 17 with no time to heal. I need to focus on myself and my career. You’re beautiful, ambitious, everything I’d want—but I can’t give you what you deserve. I want to stay friends, maybe travel, but I can’t do more than that right now.” 

He said he still liked me a lot, appreciated me, and didn’t want to hurt me—but he needed to be alone for the first time in his life. 

He also confessed that in his last relationship, he didn’t want anything serious but agreed out of pride when the girl gave him an ultimatum. He admitted that he acted like he wasn’t even in a relationship, strongly suggesting he was unfaithful. He regrets how that went, and some things from both past relationships are still emotionally triggering for him. He told me that after his last relationship ended, I was the first person he really connected with again—and he didn’t want to mess it up. 

But now I’m left confused. He said he’s not ready, but still messages me, still wants to do our travelling plans, sends me money (like he did for my graduation event), and jokes about me dating other guys. He says, “I don’t want to be an obstacle for you to meet new people,” and that he would understand if I moved on. But then he also says, “Let’s travel together again,” or that “it’s just a ‘see you later.’” 

TL;DR: Met a guy online 6 months ago. We got close, talked every day, became exclusive, and he flew to visit me twice. He talked about a future together and even said I’d design our house. But after the second trip, he said he’s not ready for a relationship — he needs to heal, be alone, and focus on work. Still, he keeps in touch, sends me money for things, and says he doesn’t want to lose me, and want to keep as friends. 

Now I’m left confused. Is he being honest, or just keeping me around? Why not let me go completely? 

Doubts (mine + my friends’): 

1. Does he truly need time alone to heal and work on himself, or is that just an excuse to push me away gently? 

2. If he isn’t ready for a relationship, why did he invest so much time, emotional energy, and money into seeing me — even twice? 

3. Why talk about a future, make promises (like designing our home, future trips, etc.), and then suddenly change direction? 

4. Is he scared of commitment, or just not interested in committing to me specifically? 

5. Is he trying to make me do the ""ending"" so he doesn’t have to be the bad guy? 

6. Why does he say I should meet other people, as if he’s completely fine letting me go — does that mean he doesn’t care that much? 

7. Could there be someone else? Is he trying to explore other options while keeping me around ""just in case""? 

8. Why does he say he doesn’t talk to his exes, yet wants to remain in touch with me? Was I never that important to him? 

9. Does he really not want to lose me — or does he just not want to feel guilty about letting go? 

10. Why does he keep making flirty jokes about me dating again— is that carelessness or emotional detachment? 

11. Was I just someone to make him feel better while he figured himself out? 

I’d love to hear honest thoughts, especially from people who’ve said “I’m not ready for a relationship” — what did you really mean?

My fiance left me may 19th,"As the tittle says my fiance left me may 19th 2025 . We were together since September 19th 2022 . I’ve been taking it hard since we were soul mates , we built a deep soul bond and it feels like I’ve had it ripped from me . She has BPD ( that’s important for the story ) 

The day she left we had a minor argument, it was early in the morning I’d say 6:30 am , she just got off work and went to pick her up and she was fine . We got home I took the dog out and she said to me “ I want to mutually break up “ it’s common for her to say that when she’s stressed out and exhausted. I kept asking her why and how can we fix this but she wouldn’t listen . So she tried working off to keep talking about me to her family . I had wrapped my arms around her to get her to calm down ( I see now that it wasn’t right and honestly dumb asf ) but she went dead weight and fell out of my arms and hurt he bed frame mind you the frame  is made of padding so it didn’t hurt much . I ended up looking at her phone and it had a text from her aunt saying “ just mutually  break up or we’ll file a PO on him “ that was when she got home . We ended up talking it out and everything was fine . We went to sleep and woke up , did our normal thing , she cooked food while I got ready for work . When I left she went back to sleep , mom came home and she was still asleep . When mom got her up for work around 8:30 pm she was fine , when she got to work around 10pm she was fine . It wasn’t until 12pm that she wanted to leave work , she even said “ I want to leave Walmart , not my house not my home “ . Well around 1:30am may 20th 2025 she ended up leaving both Walmart and me 

She get back to the house with her nana to get her cat , some paper work , and her PC. I tried to give her a hug but her nana wouldn’t let me even talk to her . That was the last time I got to actually see her . The following day may 21st 2025 she emailed me “ I miss you , I love you , and I want to come home “ 
I should have gotten her but I was at work and I couldn’t miss anymore days . So she went out to lay tile with her brother . Her brother , aunt and nana don’t like me and never really had since we met . But by Thursday may 22nd she said to me “ I’m done and over with the relationship we had “ 
She is easily manipulated by her family . 

Friday she was talking to a new guy , by that Monday ( Memorial Day ) she was dating him . I ended up getting a PO while I was at work . Had to go to court about what had happened. She put both the wrong date , and exaggerated what happen . I know she was not all there when she wrote it because I’ve compared the PO , and her journal . Days that she was scatter brained the hand writing is terrible, and had false information just like the PO. 

The day I seen her in court she looked out of it , sad asf . When I started crying in court she had her head down the whole time and couldn’t look at me. The judge only gave one year because I wrapped by arms around her , he said “ I’m just marking this as a despute because it’s nothing more then an argument “ he then looked at her and said “ you can drop it anytime or wait the year , that you guys will be fine and back together after it “ 
I was able to tell her how much I love her and would fix everything that I’d rather work on us as many times as it takes then to start over. She looked more depressed than I’ve ever seen her . After that her YouTube had a bunch of sad , depressing music like ( glimpse of us , here without you , sad country music )  , her Pinterest is her still updating thing we made together and a new board “ love letters to pookie “ she gave me that nickname. 

I can’t tell if we’re going to get back together one day or not . Her BPD is unmedicated and she don’t believe she has it even knowing her therapist told her she does. Her family is manipulating her fairly badly . I can’t tell if this new dude is a cover up or not because in a picture she posted of them together she looked hollowed in the inside like she’s being forced to do this . 

I’m sorry it’s so long I just wanted to put my story out there and see if anyone can help me because it’s been a month and a few days and I’m taking it hard asf daily . I know she was happy and loved me because a family friend of her said “ she was the happiest she’s ever seen her was with me “.

"Replaced like a used rag (a little vent about my last relationship — if you have similar experiences or advice, please share)","
I’m a 22-year-old guy and I spent 10 months seeing a 20-year-old guy.
Our relationship had many ups and downs before ending in what I believe—after hearing other stories—is one of the most sudden and brutal breakups ever.

It started as a friends-with-benefits situation with the rule that we wouldn’t tell each other about other people we were seeing. It was a kind of “out of sight, out of mind” arrangement. After about a month, he broke that rule by inviting me and another guy to an outing. We talked about it, but things didn’t change deeply—I continued seeing others, and I think he did too.

In October, it happened again: he invited that same guy for a night out with me, and a weird thing happened that disgusted me. Even so, we carried on. I still occasionally hung out with others without his knowledge. A major moment occurred in December when he went out with another guy who wanted more than just a one-off hookup—he wanted something serious, they started dating. After that, we stopped talking for about a month, during which we saw each other four times.

After that chapter, he came back to me and the relationship took a more serious turn—we started dating with the intention to become boyfriends. I stopped seeing other guys and focused on him. He didn’t. Fast forward to May: I saw him with someone else. He assured me it was just a friend, but in the following days I found out they’d slept together. That’s when the breakup happened. He told me there were problems between us (fixable stuff) and that he’d started seeing the new guy because he didn’t feel carefree with me anymore. The new guy made him feel happier, and he wanted to see where that would go. He asked me to wait for him—and wanted us to stay friends.

He threw me away carelessly. A month has passed since our last confrontation; he’s reached out to me four times. He’s playing confused, making it seem like he still doesn’t know what he wants. We both went to a friend’s birthday party and during a game of Truth or Dare, someone asked if he had feelings for anyone in the group. He refused to answer. Meanwhile, other friends tell me things with the new guy are going well—he didn’t hesitate to call him “boyfriend” after just two weeks. That’s huge considering it took him months to call me that.

It was brutal. I felt used more than ever before. I’m struggling to accept the end, and I don’t know how to approach the situation or let go.

I just want to say thank you to everyone that posted on this sub.,"It’s been just over 5 months since I went through the most gut-wrenching, soul-crushing breakup of my life… and it happened only 2 months after losing my dad.

The grief felt endless. But I promise — it does get better once you start to detach. My ex and I aren’t in strict no contact anymore, and we occasionally check in over random things, but I’m no longer holding my breath.

Reading others' stories helped me so much, so I’m sharing mine — even if it helps just one person:

- Ugly cry. As many times as you need to.  
- Let yourself feel every emotion. Don’t numb it.  
- Move your body, go outside, drink water, eat food that brings you joy.  
- Surround yourself with people who love you.  
- Sit in stillness. Pray. Breathe.  
- Imagine life with them still in it — then imagine it without. You’ll survive both.  
- Practice gratitude for the life you’ve already built.  
- And when you’re ready: stop thinking about them for a while.

TRUST ME WHEN I SAY THIS BUT I’ve done it all — begged, cried, yelled, broken down. But this week… for the first time… I feel a little hope again. The clouds are parting. There’s always a rainbow after the rain. Stay strong - you’re not alone!

we’ve been on & off for 3yrs… toxic or meant to be?,"hey guys. i need opinions. unbiased opinions. 

so, me and my ex have been on and off for 3 years. more on than off though, i will say. we started dating june 2022, dated for a year and went no contact for 5 months. we ended up getting back together for another 6 months. we went back into contact basically right after we broke up and haven’t stepped out of it since. we were basically together all last year into this year just without the title..

both times we broke up were for stupid reasons though. the biggest issues in our relationship was communication and outside influences. his friends have been a HUGE part in him making decisions based on his love life… which is a HUGE red flag, i know. i always put my foot down with this though, he tried putting his friends in our arguments and i always put a stop to it because their opinions don’t matterrrr and never did, to me at least lmao. 

so yea, basically we just went separate ways BOTH times for stupid ass reasons, when we’re both still so in love. which is exactly why we keep coming back to each other. 

we’re both young still, early 20’s. but in a way it’s like we grew up together, we spent our entire beginning of our “real adult lives” with each other. planned on moving in together, having kids, whole 9. i have never in my life felt even CLOSEEE about anyone the way i do about him. since we broke up the first time i’ve tried with other people, i tried to be more open and give other people a chance but he’s always in the back of my mind. i dream of him almost every night, still even over 3yrs later. and from what he’s told me, he feels the exact same way. he’s constantly having dreams as well and he told me that he actually “doesn’t feel comfortable with anyone else the way he does with me, he’s never been so compatible with anyone in his life” and i full heartedly agree, unfortunately. 

fast forward to current day he’s back.😂😂😂
we’re trying to work on things… but i’m at the point where either we’re locking in fr this time or we’re going our separate ways fr. i can’t do this back n forth shit anymore, it’s exhausting. iykyk. 

but i’m willing to work through everything again, i’d rather try with him 200x than with someone new. 
i’m the type of person that believes relationships and love is built off shared time and experiences. we built so much in 3-4 years that it’s just so hard for me to let go. in the long run, i know 3-4 years is not a lot. but it feels like a lot, yk? i’ve never had anyone who was my best friend and partner all in one. i’d try anything to fix it. i know i sound delusional but it’s fine. 😇 lmfaooo yall what do i do… do i even give him another chance atp? after all the healing and self work i’ve done it’s definitely gonna take me back a bit… just not sure if it will be worth it in the long run.

Angry,"I don't know if this is normal or not, it's been a bit since me and my ex fiancé split, and every time I think about her I just get this urge to scream and punch stuff. Maybe I should give a bit of context:

Me and my ex met a few years back. At first things were great and I thought that she was everything I ever wanted. I loved every single thing about her, so I end up proposing to her a bit after a year and a half. Yes I'm aware that's soon. Fuck it. But the thing is, that after that, after she said yes, that's when the problems started rearing their ugly head. 

At first it was small stuff like dismissing my sadness, telling me to deal with everything by myself, and not even wanting to listen to what was wrong because she would rather drink her brains out until she blacked out drunk, and if I tried to get her to stop drinking, she'd get violent. She'd throw bottles and choke me and hit me. You know, average everyday shit... but as time went on, she actively started insulting me toward anyone who would listen, her friends, her family... me.... 

At some point she started acting outright transphobic. Keep in mind I'm trans. She knew I was trans. From day 0 she knew. But somehow it only became an issue after over 2 years. She started misgendering me, calling me a delusional man who needed to be locked up in a conversion camp. But eventually that led to her cheating on me with guy after guy after guy. Each time it was a different dude. And if I spoke out I'd get hands thrown at me. Keep in mind I'm only 5 ft 4, and she was taller and stronger than me. She worked out A LOT. I don't. And that's just when I was about to leave. 

But that wasn't the end of it... no... of course not... but for me the final straw came one night when she decided she'd do a line of coke and... maybe I shouldn't say... I don't want to trigger any SA victims here... 

I guess my question is this: why is it that whenever I think about her I feel this combination of fear, anger, desperation, and pain. And why is it that my brain can only think to resorting to punching stuff to burn off the energy?

I (23F) broke up with my bf (24M) of 3 years. I still miss him and cant stop thinking about him.,"I broke up with my boyfriend because we had some serious issues in our relationship. Initially, he was perfect and the relationship felt too good to be true but eventually he started accusing me of things I never did (cheating, lying, meeting guys etc)   
I had zero guy friends and only hung out with my best friend, kept him updated through snapchat and was still the kindest to him even though the accusing part was draining me a lot mentally and physically. What started with accusing turned into obsession, he kept checking my phone everytime we met, accused me of cheating on him with every guy I knew (my classmates and even some of my cousins), he kept an eye on me and watched my every move. He contacted my ex and my ex told him things about me which were untrue and it took me 5 whole months to gather proofs to make my bf believe in me and have faith in me and not trust my ex. Even after that, things didn't change, he asked me to send snaps of where I was every 10 mins which hindered with my studies and my lab work and if I didn't do that, he'd verbally abuse me and call me a cheater.   
I tried breaking up with him multiple times but he'd come back begging in front of me to take him back, asking to forgive him for his mistakes and for treating me badly and saying he'd change. Being the lover girl I was, I always went back to him and forgave him, but the cycle continued.   
I wouldn't say I was a saint in our relationship, I did my share of mistakes but I made sure to change myself so that he feels safe with me. The more I made him feel safe, the more he started controlling me (he decided what id wear, where id go, whether ill go to the gym or not, I couldn't meet my(female) best friend because he was sort of jealous of her and much more)

I broke up with him and we're on no contact now but I still miss him. I miss his smile, I miss all the good times we shared, I miss him rubbing my feet, I miss when he'd bring me tea and make me pasta after a long day, he tried changing for me but he couldn't. I could see him trying, I could see how hard he was trying but I don't know what I did wrong for him to treat me like that. He had no answer to this question as well. 

so I miss him, I miss him so so much because I love him, I loved him truly and truly cared for him. Idk whether I should break the no contact or not, his last texts were that he's sorry and he'll wait for me but I asked him to move on and learn from his mistakes and he said he'll try moving on :) ",2,9,2025-06-28 17:17:21,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lms4c2/i_23f_broke_up_with_my_bf_24m_of_3_years_i_still/,,,"You miss the person he was/ wanted him to be.

"Nothing worst than a broken person entering a relationship, love bombing you and then disappearing. Leaving you in a broken state that didn’t exist before their arrival.

I wasn’t the one who was stalking and showing up at random places. I wasn’t the one who was love bombing and asking for his hand in marriage. I wasn’t the one who had a short temper.

Breakups are some of the worst pain we’ll ever feel, not just because we’re losing a partner, but because we’re losing our best friend, our home, our future plans, our emotional safety net, and it often happens so suddenly, without time to prepare. It leaves you in shock, questioning everything, especially when you still want to fight for the relationship.  You're not wrong to wish that love could be enough, that people would stay and work through the issues instead of giving up. But the truth is, not everyone knows how to stay. Some people leave not because we weren't enough, but because they weren’t equipped to meet us where we were or where we were headed.  I want to gently share a bit of my story, just so you know you're not alone in this. I was in a relationship for 15 years. He was my first love, the man I married. We built everything together, or at least I thought we did. I truly believed he was the person I would grow old with. But one day, I discovered he had cheated on me, and everything fell apart.  The pain I felt? It was beyond words. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t breathe. I didn’t know how I would ever survive without him. Like you, I wish we could have worked through it. I kept asking, Why didn’t he choose to fix it? Why didn’t he choose me? But over time, I came to understand that his leaving didn’t mean I was unlovable. It meant he couldn’t love me in the way I deserved. One day, slowly and gently, I realized that I hadn’t just lost him. I had finally made space to rediscover myself. I found peace, and I became stronger than I ever imagined I could be.  Please hold on. You're allowed to grieve. You're allowed to miss them and still know you deserve better. This pain won’t last forever, even if it feels like it will, and one day, you will look back and see that you survived something you once thought would break you.  You're not alone. You're not broken. You're just in the middle of the hardest chapter, but better pages are still being written.  Sending you a warm hug!  R. Littlecola :) ||| i feel this ||| Yup ||| It's simple, really. They didn't have those same future plans that you did, not with you anyway. That's why breakups are a thing, people can fall out of love and it's their right to end things whenever they please.  The fact that breakups exist means that you better cherish every single day your relationship lives through. Just like death forces us to appreciate life."
Bro's fallen again,"Hi, i'm new on Reddit, I actually created my account to share my story, seeking for advices. 

I'm 28 years old man, i met her in summer 2018, i seduced her, i did my best to get her, and it happened, we became a couple few months later. Two weeks after that, her dad passed away, i was there for her, everyday, everytime. we had good days, bad days, i wasn't the best for her, but i was working on my self to improve. we had small fights, we had our first kiss and so on.  She wanted to keep her virginity for marriage, i respected her choice, and never did it. We fouled around so many times, that it almost happened. 

I knew she loved me, and i did too, she was jealous of other girls i was talking to (there were a lot), and i was jealous of boys around her, but eventually, no harm happened from the outside. 2020, 2021, the two full years were shit, lockdown, working again, lockdown, working again... after two years like that, i had a breakdown and quitted my job in 2022, i gained weight and depressed for many months, we broke up for a month in summer 2022, but get back together after that. the shit kept going for me, i couldn't get out of my situation, so we wasn't meeting a lot, once a month, at best. i was turning around in my life, i lose purpose of everything, i was trying to figure it out and couldn't handle a relationship, but i did my self and gave the bare minimum, it's never enough. Summer 2023, we fought for some reason and she didn't text me for a month, she came back and asked to talk, i waited a month to accept ""her departure"" and the we got back together, again... i know that feelings and love fade away, from both sides, but we stick together, of the old good times, we didn't want to throw away what we had together, the future that we wanted to achieve. December 2023, we fought again and didn't talk for like 3 months, we eventually talked again in february, i had to make the first move and we got back together again. there was a new sparkle, we were more open and talked better, for the first time, we really opened up about everything. (sexuality obviously, even if we hadn't sex, we did other things), two months later, her mother was diagnosed with cancer, and she died two months later, so, i was here for here, more than ever, i drove here when needed, i cheer her up, and take care of her as best as i could. 

  
2025, new year, same shit, i became absent again, less and less available, i was finally, getting back to my old self, i was ""recovering from the burnout"", i lost like 30kg and i started to feel good again, but, i eventually sacrificed some time with her, talking, calling, seeing each others... end of april, we fought for some shitty reason, she told me that she's done with me, i was angry so i let her talk, and i let her go. I waited and expected her to come back, to talk and sort it out. But, she never did, so do i. 

  
We remained friends on social media, but didn't talk for like two months. The first month, i regained some weight, i had to drown my pain, so i did eat and forgot about her. Few weeks ago, i decided that it's over, i'm getting back to my life again, so i stopped all the patching up things, and for the first time in five years, i'm feeling good again, i got back to reading, to having a purpose, to see in front of me. And then, i started thinking about her, about us, and i was, and still am, disappointed. Because she didn't come back for me, because of everything i've done for her, it wasn't enough, i wasn't worth it ? I don't know if it's love, care or just bruises of the past that keeping me down, but this last days were very hard, the only thing that kept me from talking to her was the idea of disappointment. Maybe i'm right, maybe i'm wrong. 

  
Few days ago, i noticed a new friend on her social media, someone living in another town, 100-150 km maybe ? (she doesn't have many friends on social media and don't accept invitations...), that's when it became harder for me. A lot of questions, of thinking, of everything... of trying not to talk to her and today, something happened. 

  
In the past two months, i didn't meet her, today, after my gym, i went to the supermarket and saw her in aisle, she passed just in front of me, and dropped her eyes down, i bought my things, paid, and couldn't go. So, i waited for her outside to have a talk. She was hostile, not smiling, and took me for responsible. We talked for like 30 minutes, and i just can't help it, i felt dissatisfaction. She was seeing me like an unknown asshole, and all the time we spent together was never happened, i was wondering, how in earth, something like that can happen, so quickly. We agreed to have a talk later and maybe to meet this week to sort things out. 

So, here i am, sharing my story, i don't know where i am. But, i feel like she moved on. I don't know if i just want to hurt her and get my revenge of all this disappointment, to move on. What do you think ? Do you have any advices or ideas to share ? 

  
I'm not a saint, i did a lot of bad things too, most that she didn't know, which i had to live with. And maybe, i'm just releasing her from my dark web, maybe i'm the bad guy in the story...

Question for all that have been dumped and all the dumpers,"I have been dumped (m to m)-we dated 3 months and have been broken up 2 months already.
We saw eachother 2 x week-
As FWB and I was ok with that but the other 5 days he would text me everyday how he missed me and thinking of me-
I developed feelings - the 5 days I didn’t see him he kept his schedule secret-
I know of work and family responsibilities-
Last time I questioned and accused him of cheating - which I think he was throughout as he wanted no commitments but at the same time he told me he loved me and missed me-
I did no contact and was doing well until he texted me to wish me happy birthday and have a good life (I thought a cruel text) considering he knows my feelings -he told me move on as he did move on.
I still have hope .
Quest is if someone tells you they moved on is there a chance they will come back?

My perspective as someone who moved on quickly from my last relationship,"Hey everyone, I got curious and browsed through this sub and noticed a lot of people were asking why their ex moved on quickly after their relationship and I just wanted to offer my perspective.

For reference I am a young male and the relationship I am in now with my girlfriend is by far so so much better than my last and I am so much happier now. I know I am young, and maybe still a little dumb but I just want to share my perspective as it may offer a different view point. 

My last relationship lasted 2 years and to be honest, was not the best relationship. I remember not really feeling that ""feeling"" towards her. I believe at the time I genuinely liked her, I just wasn't sexually attracted to her. She wasn't ugly or anything, I just didn't feel that feeling you get when you're with someone you are sexually attracted to. The best way I can describe it is that It was like kissing my sister. It just didn't feel good. I did, however, at the time, believed that it was just my fault I was like that. She was my first for a lot of things so I just didn't have a lot to compare to so I just assumed something was wrong with me. On top of this, we had a lot of arguments as well. She was a very jealous and insecure person which led to many issues regarding friends. 

About a year in the relationship, I went to lunch with my friend F and M in between class. I told her after the fact and she got so upset to the point where she was crying and yelling at me. I believe that was the point that the relationship changed forever and was the beginning of the end. I should've ended it there and it is one of my biggest regrets regarding that relationship. However I just couldn't do it and chose comfort over being uncomfortable for a while. 

Fast forward another year, we had other moments like this and also more issues on top of that, I finally got to the point where I was so sick and tired of her I decided to end it. It was a MESS. She was crying and yelling and it got so bad to the point where I decided to stay with her. I should've stuck to my guns but I just couldn't. 

A couple months after that she finally ended it with me and about a month later I met my current girlfriend and it's been the best ever since. I am so attracted to her I finally know what that feels like to be intimate with someone you love. We don't argue, and we both have our respective friends which we all know. I love her so much and if she broke up with me right now, I know for sure I would not be able to move on for a good while. 

Sorry if this post got long, I just wanted to offer my perspective as to why I moved on so quickly and to maybe hear some feedback. If you have any questions feel free to ask I am open to answering.

The Worst Part of Healing,"The worst part of healing isn’t the silence.
It isn’t the tears.
It isn’t the loneliness that crawls into bed with you at night.

No.
The worst part… is when you feel her soul everywhere you go.

She’s in the streets I walk.
In the songs that randomly play.
In the food I used to love.
In the air I breathe.
Even in the laughter of strangers passing by—somehow, some way, I feel her in it.

It’s like the world refuses to let me forget her.
And maybe that’s what’s breaking me the most.

Sometimes, I swear I want to run away.
Not just from her memory—but from myself.
Leave this country, this city, these streets.
Pack up my heart and move somewhere far, far away—somewhere her soul didn’t touch.
But deep down I know…
Even if I stood on the other side of the planet,
she’d still be with me.
Because healing isn’t about distance.
It’s about facing the ghosts that live inside you.

You know what hurts the most?
Trying to move through the world without the same fire I once had.
When she was with me, I felt unstoppable.
Confident. Powerful.
Like I could build an empire with my bare hands.
She was the wind in my sails, the voice in my head that whispered, “You’ve got this.”

And yes… it’s true what they say:
Behind every strong man, there’s a strong woman.
But not just any woman—
It has to be someone who believes in you.
Wholeheartedly.
Unconditionally.

She was that woman.
Until she wasn’t.

The day she stopped believing in me…
Was the day I stopped believing in myself.

It was like someone had pulled the plug on my soul.
No more spark.
No more fire.
No more pushing myself to be more.
I used to go the extra mile—hell, I’d run marathons—just to see her happy.
Just to make her proud.

Now?
Now I do the bare minimum.
Just enough to get by.
Medium.
Average.
Lukewarm.

Nothing exciting.
Nothing new.
No hunger.
No passion.

And that…
That is the cruelest part of this healing process:
Losing the best version of yourself.

Not because life took it.
Not because time faded it.
But because the person who brought it out of you is gone.

I’m not just mourning her.
I’m mourning me.
The “me” that laughed louder.
That loved harder.
That believed anything was possible.

So here I am…
Not just trying to forget her—
But trying to find myself again.

And that… is a heartbreak all on its own.",19,12,2025-06-28 00:32:35,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm9pez/the_worst_part_of_healing/,,,"I’m so sorry, man.

"I F24 am feeling lost after M25 left me, only to reconcile after sitting with himself for 3 months.  Need advice and insights.","Hi all,

I’m feeling overwhelmed and unsure about where to go from here, so I’m hoping for some outside perspective.

My husband and I recently gave up our city center studio apartment in May. It was expensive (€1400, though I managed to negotiate it down to €1000), and he was very adamant about moving out and finding himself again. He NEEDED to be alone but mostly due to cost and lack of space. I had doubts about ending the lease, especially since it was unlimited and felt like our shared space, but I went along with it. Considering we had painful talks about separating and how he felt like he wasn’t himself since September (job losses, depression etc.) and it all took a turn for the worse. I didn’t know about this until after and since I could barely listen to him and was dealing with my own job loss it was a recipe for disaster, so I am also to blame but I can see where we both went wrong and so does he. His cries for him not being himself anymore fell on deaf ears since I myself didn’t even know who I myself was anymore either. We had many heart to heart talks since then, I myself just have a hard time trusting and believing he won’t leave again in the future. 

We were disconnected for a a solid three months where we were barely speaking. Think about one text a week to randomly check in. But once the lease ended, he slowly started helping again and even supported me while I moved back in with my parents. We’re now technically dating again and spending a lot of time together.. It’s to the point where he recently stayed over at my parents’ place.

The situation is confusing. I don’t know where our relationship stands long-term, and being back in my childhood room, surrounded by family opinions and expectations, is really hard. They have a right to voice this of course but it is messing with my head. I feel like a ping-pong ball between what everyone else thinks I should do.

Meanwhile, I’ve been offered a job in Greece (Apple support role). It’s not amazing, but it pays €1000 net and includes free accommodation for the first few months. Part of me wants to go… Not because it’s a dream job, far from it honestly considering its customer service / sales, but because I feel overwhelmed by everyone around me. I crave space, clarity, and time to reconnect with myself. I feel like I’ve lost that sense of who I am. I don’t like to say this but perhaps I’m burned out? But that is me thinking out loud. 

Truthfully, I’m simply scared. What if I’m just running away? What if I regret leaving the country while things with my husband feel unfinished? Even when he says he will support me no matter what and won’t make the same mistake again, will he leave again in the future? And what if going turns out to be the best thing I could’ve done? Even if it’s temporary? 

Right now, even simple things like unpacking my boxes feel exhausting. They’re still stacked in my childhood room and it has been well over a month. I don’t have the energy to make big decisions but I also know staying stuck is draining me and not the option. I’ve been stuck for too long now. And my parents are genuinely not helping nor my partner. I can’t come over to his place cause his dad has shown I am not welcome. He is at my parents place but they’re just on my ass and my mom literally just texted me how I do not understand or whatever. Worst part? I do. And I am just simply exhausted from hearing all the nagging and keeping everyone their happiness in consideration. I feel caged. 

If you’ve been through something similar, I’d love to hear how you navigated it. Any insights and advice are truly appreciated! 

Thanks for reading if you’ve got this far!

Solo traveling as a way of healing?,"I just went through very emotional and painful breakup. I’m devastated and feel so empty. I realized I can’t keep depending on other people and that I need to focus on myself, my needs and my well-being. I keep living in past and don’t know how to escape it. I feel like this (other than therapy) might me the only thing that will save me.

I just bought flight tickets to Mexico as a volunteer at hostel (from Europe). I’m 20, have traveled a lot with my family (so I’m familiar with traveling) and I’ve always had the desire to do such thing. To left everything behind for a month and experience something new and on my own. To heal and possibly start loving myself again and let go of grief. I feel like staying in place will suffocate me. The month will pass anyway. I either do it or not.

On the other hand I feel so much fear. Of abandonment, of loneliness, of not fitting in, of lonely evenings, long bus rides, dining all alone. Of crisis where the only thing I need is to hug someone.

Has anyone been in the same or similar situation? What did it give you? What have you learnt? About yourself, about world? Have you learnt some new perspectives? Did it help you heal? How did you feel during and afterwards?

What does the one being broken up with feel?,"I finished my 2.5 years relationship with my bf because we had very big character incompatibilities but nothing ""bad"" happened (no cheating, no mistreating...), he is a very good man with his human flaws as we all do. 
The thing about this decision is that it hurts like a nightmare. I am having the worst heart ache of my life and staying in no contact is devastating because i still love him. 
And one of the worst things is not knowing what he may be feeling. I cannot ask him of course,
and this may be grieving, or me trying to ease the pain, but if anyone in a similar situation could help me know what he is going through, even if its rage, anger, whatever, I just want to know... i am not sure why, but it keeps me thinking at night 😢",3,1,2025-06-28 10:18:56,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmjgjb/what_does_the_one_being_broken_up_with_feel/,,,Honestly he's probably devastated but understands.

(tw sh) don’t know how to handle breakup struggling with mental health,"My long distance bf broke up with me a couple months ago.  I have struggled with SH and mental health my whole life, but he really was my rock when it came to that. I hadn’t sh in 2 years (shortly after we met) and he really helped me with that, along with many other things in my life. I have not reached out or told him this, as I do not expect anything of him, nor do I think it is his responsibility to help me with it anymore, I do not blame him or say this to fault him, he is not responsible for my actions, i just want to make that clear. but i am really struggling and have relapsed multiple times since the breakup. I have an appointment with a therapist at the end of August (earliest they had available for me, I can’t afford private therapy). I know it is not healthy to put all of your happiness into one person, but it is extremely hard when you really don’t have any other friends or family in your life. When you’re in that mindset, it is virtually impossible to get out of it in the moment (for me at least). Is there anything I can do to try and ease this and stop thinking so obsessively about it, my depression and mental health has gone severely down hill since the breakup and I don’t have any support .. I don’t know if i’m allowed to post something like this here, so I do apologise if not.

I (29F) and my partner (33M) have been together 5 years yet I thought things would be different so many years on.,"Me and my partner live together and have two cats and I own the house. He has always struggled financially and currently is on an IVA (UK debt support with paying money back) and he owes me £10k. Most of this is unpaid rent/bills, car, shopping+. 
I have from the start set that I want my money back within a set time frame yet this is always being delayed by sickness or something else which is *priority*. So 3 years on he still owes me the money and has only paid me back £900. 
I have held back my career and not applied for jobs as we couldn't afford to have no income for a month. I am sick of taking sole responsibility and this has affected how I see him and relationships in general. 
I don't always feel like my needs are hear or priority. 

If I lived on my own I could save money. I would be lonely there is that. And he would be in a shit position which I don't have hard feelings and want him to be yet I am now thinking the only way I can protect my own financial and mental needs is just to scrap relationships in general. 

I have been in contact with an ex (they contacted me) who although I don't have feeling for I could see something casual with. I think that may work better? 

It's daunting yet I am thinking I just don't want relationships in futures yet only friends with benefits/casual friends yet how likely is this?",1,1,2025-06-28 16:00:52,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmqaly/i_29f_and_my_partner_33m_have_been_together_5/,,,"First, I think the suggestions of ""FWB"" and ""scrap relationships in general"" are just your heart trying to cope. I think you know deep down that you don't really want that.  Second, your partner is never going to pay you back. Ever. So, accept the loss of money, kick him out, find a roommate (or two), and then go find a better job. You deserve better -- a better man, a better job, and a better life. And the only thing holding you back from that is your fear. Please stand up for yourself and go find the respect that you deserve."
"Moving fast after a breakup? Need honest advice on a new relationship that feels “too good to be true""","Hello I 23F broke up with my partner of 2 years on May 29. It was a serious relationship, and I’ve been processing a lot since then. About 5 weeks later, I met someone new 22M (June 18), and we started dating around June 23–24.

We’ve quickly grown very close. Spending lots and lots of time together every day, talk about future visits and even children. This is his first serious relationship, while it’s not mine.

I feel really safe, heard, and connected, but my gut also says, “Is this moving too fast? Is it too good to be true?” I told him this, and he said he feels the same but encouraged me not to overthink.

I’m trying to stay grounded and intentional, but it’s hard with all these intense feelings and excitement. We’ve been vulnerable emotionally and sexually, and it feels special.

Here are some questions I’m thinking of asking him to deepen our connection and keep things real.

1. What does a healthy, lasting relationship look like to you?


2. How do you usually handle conflict or misunderstandings with someone you care about?


3. What’s something you’re working on within yourself right now?


4. What kind of support do you need when life gets stressful?


5. If we were to visit each other, what would an ideal first visit look like for you?



Reddit, do you think I’m moving too fast? How do I balance excitement with caution in a new relationship, especially early on? Any advice or personal stories would be appreciated.

Thanks so much!

I don’t think this necessarily has something to do with your breakup but those types of conversations/talk for hours dates can build attachment with words fast before you have time to see action.  That’s how you feel in love in two weeks and ignore dirtbag behavior.  Maybe read about moving at the speed of trust, and those questions are fine but also don’t as a rule spend all your time with a guy over friends even at the exciting start…or get hooked on words vs going slow enough to see him act in different situations.  This way you don’t get so patched up you won’t then have to “fight” your own first impression/limerence if something is off.  Learned the hard way."
I need advice,Me (22M) and my ex (20F) broke up about 3 months ago ( it was mutual) we haven’t spoke in 42 days when we first broke up I kind of chased and she pushed me away so after a few try’s I gave up.

will he come back?,"I (18F) and my ex (20M) were dating for 6 months. Before that, we had a 3-month situationship. After we broke up, we spent 2 months flirting and FaceTiming every day. Our relationship felt perfect: we'd call each other 24/7, flirt, work, study, and even sleep on the phone daily. Of course, we both hung out with our own friends and gave each other space.

However, we hung out together once, and I brought my friend (worst mistake), because they got into a fight and it was super awkward. After that, he wanted to hang out with me again, but I kept refusing because I wasn’t really comfortable—especially since my parents are against me dating (though my mom knows about him). We had even planned for him to call my mom. Meanwhile, I already knew his mom and his friends and would say hi to them daily.

We don’t live or go to university together. Our houses are about an hour’s drive apart, so it was hard to see each other. Anyway, my brother kind of knew about us, and he went and told my parents, which caused so much drama. I wanted to end things, and he kind of understood and agreed.

Later on, for the following 2 months, he kept flirting. But halfway through that time, he started acting distant, and we got into a fight. He said, *“I love you and can’t be friends, but I’m trying to make you hate me.”* Then 3 weeks later, he was in a talking stage with someone else and was telling me all about her. Two weeks later, they broke up because *“he didn’t feel the vibe,”* but then he met a new girl.

I told him I couldn’t be friends because I still had feelings, and we entered no contact. After a week, I lost 5 kg and was fainting and throwing up from panic attacks. I called him, and he comforted me for an hour before we hung up.

A month later, I texted him to ask if he was okay and how his finals were going. He was totally dry, so I took the hint that he didn’t want to talk. He left me on read and unfollowed me on literally everything (Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok) three hours later. Thank God he removed me too so I don’t look like a fan or something.

The problem is, I can’t move on. This incident was literally 3 weeks ago, and we’ve been in no contact since May 7. People say he’s trying to move on but can’t, which is why he unfollowed me. Others say he hates me. And some say, *“They always come back.”*

I want to know your opinion on whether or not he'll come back.",1,5,2025-06-28 15:38:27,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmprnq/will_he_come_back/,,6 month(s),"Move on.

Is there hope after growing apart and breaking up? Please help,"Me 27M and girlfriend 26F have recently broken up due to ""growing apart"" after a 7 year relationship.

We still live together while we sort out selling the house. We still love eachother (I think she still lives me but I definitely love her ).
We plan on buying our own houses after selling.

She means everything to me and I want to marry this girl and have kids with her. I think about her all the time. All I want to do is turn back time. The breakup was mature and we are still friends. While it was mutual, it was mainly fie to her bit being happy.

Do you you think there is any bit of hope that we will get back together in the future. I want to be the man that she needs, I'm willing to do absolutely anything for her. I've spent so much time thinking about my mistakes and how I could do things better. I feel like I've matured more in the last month that in the last 2 years.

How can I try to fix things? 
Is it better to wait until we move apart to give us some time away from eachother first?
Or should I talk to her before we sell the house?
Her friendship is very important too me and I don't want to do anything that would jeopardize that.

I [f22]haven't been feeling my best I just got into a new relationship and he's [m21] doing the similar things my last partner did and I told myself I will never go through that again...,"So my current boyfriend has been triggering me to the point where I’m shutting down I get my past is my problem but I’ve told him things I don’t like and he hasn’t changed anything and I know it takes time but the way I work is at least taking steps when you are told there’s an issue. Everything is the same in my eyes because nothing hasn’t been done. 
Example 1 
I told him I don’t like him following OF girls because it makes me feel physically sick. And makes me want to relapse my ED.
And found porn tabs all in his phone. 
His response 
That was the old me and I don’t consume that stuff. 

Backstory 
My last partner consumed porn very bad to the point where I saw him looking up local prostitutes and when talking about it he called me insecure. 
My new bf knows this 

Example 2 
I told him I’m kinda uncomfortable with him following his exes 

His response 
I only follow them because we didn’t end on bad terms 

Backstory 
My last partner started following his last partner and laughing  in my face when I wanted to talk about it and told me to not worry about it that he hasn’t talked to her yet.
Again my bf knows this 

Example 3 
He was on the phone last night with his friend and his friend said tell that b!tch to go home so we can play OW mind you I don’t mind I just usually sleep when they play but my bf uses me as an excuse to not play with his friends at times 
I told his friend to basically stfu and he asked why my bf always has his phone on speaker and my bf didn’t say anything at all. He didn’t say hey man don’t talk like that about my gf nothing I had to speak up. 

Backstory 
My last partner would let his friends and family talk shit about me and never stood up for me 

Now every time I’m upset he asks me what he can do and he will do whatever I tell him to make me happy 
But I don’t want that it makes me feel like I’m controlling. And in my head and heart I know if we take that path he will soon get tired of this relationship and I don’t want that. 
He wants to stay together and says he loves me a lot and I just don’t know what to do I want to protect myself.

Sorry to whoever is reading this I know it’s messy..

"He apologized after dumping me, now what?","
My ex (33m) and I (31f) were together for 6 years. He is a complicated guy and broke up with me because he wasn’t sure if he wanted to commit to marriage and kids, while also stating he wanted more spontaneity and intimacy. It’s now been 9 months since we’ve broken up. He’s asked twice if I would be open to listening to his reflections but I’ve said no, knowing I’d be too emotional. 

Recently, he wrote me a long apology email. Making it clear it wasn’t my fault, he didn’t know how to communicate his needs, and he wished he’d been more open throughout a relationship that had so much love. 

This really made me sad. It’s tragic he couldn’t get over his own emotional barriers. However, he is the one that went through with dumping me after so many years. 

Part of me wants to hear him out but the other part doesn’t know what good it will bring. 

Advice? It’s like he wants closure but he’s the one who dumped me lol like they say… he always comes crawling back. Is it ever okay to accept that? ",9,10,2025-06-28 02:35:22,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmc1vl/he_apologized_after_dumping_me_now_what/,,6 year(s),"I know the preferred sentiment is to move on and all that but honestly I'll offer an alternate perspective in saying do whatever you feel is right. Are you with anyone at the moment? Are you happy with or without this person in your life? What is it you hope you'll gain from this conversation? Do you want to move on?   These are all questions you can ask yourself while deciding to speak to him again. It is honestly nice to hear he wrote you an apology email. You know him better than any anonymous user on here so it's your call as to whether it feels genuine or not.   Do whatever you think is best. I hope you get the outcome you want either way. ||| Ask yourself if you did take the meeting what would you want from it?  Are you likely to get it?  Has he changed or done the learning he needed to do to be ready for a relationship that is committed?  Then maybe you can make what is a very hard decision that could be a negative or positive experience. ||| Just keep in mind that he might broke your heart again, if he ever feels confused again, maybe he is panicking for the feeling that might lost you this time, but who knows how long that is going to last?   Sorry I’m on a similar situation so maybe i took it too personal 🤗 ||| I don’t know if you should have this meeting or not. However, I think it’s good of him to have taken responsibility for his mistakes. It shows he’s grown, or worked on himself. However, I would take that at face value, I’m not sure that means he wants to get back at all, and if you meet him you may be profoundly disappointed.   Whatever you decide to do it will be correct. But if you decide to meet, please be prepared for any possible outcome.   Good luck! ||| Dump him ||| Do you know what his purpose is for reaching out? Like does he want to get back together, does he just want to talk? Does he want closure? He has a responsibility to have clear communication, especially when he said that he didn't know how to communicate his needs earlier. Remember you have to have healthy communication too. ||| If you still have feelings for him, then go to couples therapy together, work together, grow together.  Because it seems he clearly came to his senses and did his part of reaching out and knowing his problem.  Now it’s up to you if you’d go for another round.  I think most couples forget the part where there’s only the two of you, and if one sucked at communicating and the other only know they suck but don’t know how to make it better, a third person, a counsellor/therapist would be needed.  But that is if BOTH of you want it to work. ||| Don’t respond. No response is a response.  His reaching out is either a way for him to assuage his guilt or it’s a way for him to circle back and worm his way into your life.   Focus on yourself and on healing from the relationship. You don’t need to have another can of worms opened when you’re still healing from this relationship."
The truth about getting back with an ex,"The truth is that you can’t change who they are at their core.

That no amount of understanding, empathy, love, effort, patience or self-improvement on your part will ever be enough to turn the wrong person into the right one or force someone to show up in a way that they’re either unwilling or incapable of.

You can influence, communicate and inspire growth.

But, you cannot directly change their emotional capacity, core-values, priorities, attachment style or the depth of their feelings for you.

Doing that will leave you frustrated, drained and stuck in a dynamic where you’re constantly auditioning for someones love while losing your self-respect and abandoning yourself in the process.

At some point, the most powerful form of love is knowing when to accept someone for who they are and from there decide if whether or not they are aligned with who you are, what you’re willing to give, what you need and what you want a relationship to be like.

After all, relationships only thrive when both people meet each other as they are, not as projects to fix or potential to unlock.

Is why things like marrying and committing to someone in the long term is a big, life-changing decision that needs to be made not just with emotion but, also with wisdom, foresight and rationale.

Because once you made the decision to reconcile with an ex you shouldn’t be with, there’s often no easy way out of this and especially if you end up having kids with the wrong person, you’ll be stuck with and in some ways tied to them forever whether you want that or not.

Such outcomes can be avoided by learning from other peoples mistakes.

By, again, not trying to force a fit when it’s not there and instead only get and stay in relationships with people who are deeply aligned with you and vice versa.",150,25,2025-06-27 11:46:21,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1llrt0u/the_truth_about_getting_back_with_an_ex/,,,"I had every bandage. I knew what she needed because I’ve been there. I didn’t want to fix her because she was broken. I wanted to help her heal because she deserved it.  Even if she comes back after cheating because of her own unhealed trauma.  I'd rather die than take her back.  Moral of story. DO NOT take back your ex. ||| Just broke up with my ex last night. He was a great man with so many good qualities about him. Probably the best man I've ever been with, but I'm a very lovey dovey person and he just wasn't that way. I was always wanting more intimacy when he was already maxed out. And I told him I loved him last night even though I probably shouldn't have but he said I didn't because I didn't accept him. But I do love him. It's just I feel incomplete in the relationship. I have a desire for more intimacy which he was unwilling to meet. Currently bed rotting all day ||| I learned my lesson after breaking no contact and talking to my ex-girlfriend a month after we broke up. I had spent that time lost in daydreams, imagining us getting back together, believing she would change, picturing how happy we could be. But the truth is, she hadn’t changed at all during our time apart. Just one conversation was enough to make me lose all faith in the relationship. That’s when I let go. I gave up on her.  My mom once told me something that really stuck: You shouldn’t have to ask a grown person to change to keep you. They should want to change on their own, because they realize they need to, because they can’t imagine life without you, and most importantly, because they know they need to grow for themselves.  We can’t fix anyone. It’s important to let it go. ||| 40F here.  I was with my first ex for 8 years.  We were virgins, highschool sweethearts.  As time went on, we fought almost weekly.  He started verbally abusing me, treating me like shit and just overall we weren't happy with each other anymore.  And yet, he refused to dump me, and tried to bait me into dumping him because to the rest of the world, he portrayed himself as the ""nice guy"".   His family and friends loved him as the guy who would do anything who needed help (except for me).  His facade was so convincing that no one believed me when I told his friends he raped me, called me names, etc.  We were on and off for about a year trying to make it work.   One day, it dawned on me as I was leaving his apartment - he hasn't changed.  He will never change.  He was still an asshole who was balding and became obese over the years.  He smelled bad.  And he still trying to break me down when my life was going well, I stayed in shape and I was finishing school.   I realized he needed me more than I needed him, and if he truly cares for me, he would've been a better person.  It took probably about 4 times to permanently leave him for good.   There is no shame to going back.  It's your journey after all.  The only way it will work is if both parties are willing to get professional help (mine refused).  By leaving my ex, I opened myself to the opportunities of dating other men.  Looking back, I'm glad I stayed away, even if the other relationships didn't work out, it just shows that I survived an abusive relationship, I've grown wiser, and if I ever find myself in that type of situation again, I know I have the strength to walk away ||| If they realize they need help and put in the work to heal themselves through therapy (and medication, if necessary), then I would absolutely take them back. In a heartbeat. ||| Honestly, the only time I've seen it work is when both people go on their own journey over the course years and change on their own. Both people have to want it equally, and you have to truly let go of the past. When people rush to get back together, it usually fails because not enough time has passed for anything to actually change. ||| This is very good advice especially this part ""only thrive when both people meet each other as they are, not as projects to fix or potential to unlock.""  I knew within 3-4 mos that me and my X would not be compatible. To my credit i asked certain things in the beginning and she tried to fit that knowing she was the complete opposite. This however is as much as my fault because it became obvious about 3-4 mos that she wasnt that person. She still tried to hide it to a point ( or make excuses to hid her real self) but then eventually more and more started to come out.  What it turned into was she trying to make me  accept things as they are and me trying to to get her to change. At 6-7 mos in i knew this would not work out and we even discussed breaking up. That little voice told me to take the out then! I did not and continued on. We lasted about a year then she broke things off. We got back together 2 mos later and it was exactly the same maybe even a little worse. Without me making huge compromises and just accepting whatever she did this was not going to work. Even if we tried it 5 more times!  In total it was about 2 years and that was about 18 mos too long. Dont date based on future potential or hoping that person will change ( or you can get them to change)  to fit what you are looking for. Dont ignore red flags or big compatibility issues. Dont take own any projects and think that you can change or help them to be the person you are looking for. Date the person for who they are today not what they might be or what you like them to be in 2 years. It almost always ends in failure. ||| I think I need to read this post multiple times.   Thank you ||| I really needed to hear this. Incredibly eloquent, thank you! ||| I hate to break it to you but human beings are very changeable. Even if you follow the golden rules that you outlined here, there’s no guarantees in life that the perfectly aligned person you were so careful to find will stay that way.  I had never been so aligned on every level with my wife when we first met. We didn’t even have a serious disagreement for about 7 great years. Once my wife got pregnant, she was never the same person (which she freely admits that she’s changed which is rather maddening if you’re really wanting the original, not the changed version).  Five years ago she told me we were finished and she wanted a divorce, completely out of the blue. She turned into a complete asshole if I am being completely honest. Anyhow, I accepted her choice and moved out. Six months later, she changed her mind and wanted to reconcile, all during COVID. I slowly started dating her again and she seemed to be in a better headspace after therapy so I moved home. Why did I move home? Because my wife is still capable of being that person I fell for in the first place. My wife also comes from a family with a history of mental illness on both sides. My wife has issues. Some people might abandon someone who seems more trouble than they are worth at times but I actually don’t like the thought of the mother of my kid being abandoned when she clearly has these deep rooted issues."

Light at the end of the tunnel,"Isn’t it crazy, 
How difficult it is to recover your life after loving someone who isn’t there anymore?

It’s like you forgot that you had a whole life before them. That you have struggled and succeeded, and have overcome so many things to make your life so damn wonderful and stable. 

You meet someone; they break your heart, and it’s like you can’t figure out which way to go anymore. It pushes you off your rocket. It’s like you were standing in a room with them holding your hand; and suddenly, the lights go out and you can’t find your place or position anymore. You just feel lost, blind, and eventually numb. 

You can’t see. And, their hand is no longer there.

You are just alone now. And it feels like you’re dying, in a sense, because they are gone. Well, you feel like that part of your life is now dead. 

And you’re just feeling around the room for some sense of bearing. 

And some days, all you can do is sit down in the dark and cry. Like it feels like you don’t have the mental energy to find the escape door of the room by yourself. Like you weren’t even meant to be in this damn room alone. 
I mean, who does escape rooms by themselves?! 

Wasn’t this supposed to be a team effort? Fuck. 

You just surrender, and you feel stuck. 

You pray for a light at the end of the tunnel so you can make it out. 

You just wait and wait for the tiniest gleam of hope and light, that maybe you’ll find your way out.

How crazy it is to think, these few months can totally destabilize you in such a profound way.


You had a beautiful amazing life before them.

They left you,

And you need to find the light 


To leave the room. 

And when you’re ready, you will.

Self accountability required or the guy was actually wrong?,"I [24F] met this guy [24M] who was a colleague back when we were both 22. We didn’t interact much but I had a little crush on him but I am just the type of girl who wouldn’t do anything abt it unless the guy is interested. After 4 months of relationship he started showing interest and I being very inexperienced got very excited and we both immediately got into a relationship without him proving to me that he actually understands/knows my type and chooses me for it. We didn’t had much bonding we knew each other less and now were gf bf and started love bombing each other. As time passed we planned to move abroad together for studies and settling abroad and also introduce our families. At that time as I knew the guy he seemed fine with good views about women as wives and everything looked fine. We both got a little depressed when we moved abroad and we got very close to each other, he would stay on calls with me all day because we were in different cities and also visited me on weekends. We decided to talk about marriage to our families because it was very lonely abroad but both of our familes thought that we were too young for marriage so may be just an engagement. 

As time passed, my sister went through a divorce because that guy turned out to be a cheater and it came to her knowledge on a random day after knowing him for two years. We also have history of our father cheating on our mom and our mom telling us about it so it was very traumatic for all of us. I got traumatised and got very careful and discussed with my guy that we got betrayed and how can we know who people really are and one should be careful before marrying because people dont show who they really are and I am traumatised so I got a little against marriage. I still wanted to marry him but I think I kind of projected my trauma on him and said that I want to be careful when getting married and want to take time and test the guy before marrying. I guess i needed him to understand me there but I also didnt think about that it might make him insecure. Anyways he used to get triggered with all of it and say that you cant test someone completely before marraige. We both are muslims and I used to feel guilty about getting close with him and now I also wanted to be careful about marrying too early so I very respectfully communicated to the guy that its not good to get so close before marraige so we will try to limit the meetups a bit and be mindful of the religion. He agreed. Later on we had arguments about how will we live after marraige, will he call his parents abroad to live with us. My mother was abused by living with my father’s family so I never wanted this. I told him that this is something I dont want to do so what does he thinks about it and how to handle it. There was a lot tension between us for weeks about this and then since I have this tendency to get it fixed I talked to him and he said some words which I accepted as the solution to this problem.

Later on he started pulling away as I limited his access to me. One of his close relative died so I thought he was disturbed by it. He also started having issues at his job and was supposed to find a new job. I tried to support him in his job search a lot but I was not experienced that it might offend him as he wouldn’t like my advice and it might make him feel weak. He would sometimes take it and sometimes just ignore so I figured he is not liking it and I stopped. We also had some conversation about marraige, pregnancy and I said things like I am very afraid of pregnancy and Its too young for marriage. But I never said that I didnt want it with him. Anyways he also joked about getting engaged and I considered it as a joke and refused because it felt like he wasnt serious and my family at that time was dealing with the process of my sister’s divorce and I couldnt bring up the topic of my engagement at that time. I didnt even think about it. But then I travelled to my family because my sister was going through a tough time and we all decided to come to her. Meanwhile my guy and I had some arguments which I though got resolved but it didn’t got resolved for him becuas he is an avoidant and didnt communicate that he is upset still on that. Anyways he started having debates with me about how the life abroad is shit and out home country was better and also about feminism is double standards etc. All of these sensitive topics that will trigger me, i was travelling with family so I didn’t argue much with him and just accepted the fact that he is trying to pin me. We wouldn’t talk for days and just have surface level conversations. I tried to be patient with him but then I lost it and complained to him that why he wouldn’t ask what Ive been upto does he nit think about me. During this conversation I got to know that i am not his gf anymore because its against religion and I am not marrying him just testing him so he wont be a bf and wont ask me stuff like If I reached home safely because its not his “responsibility” as he is not my husband yet. I was so shocked I asked him when were you gonna tell me all this because i am still acting as your gf and he said that he couldn’t tell me so I was supposed to figure it out on my own. He said he still wants to marry me but not stay a bf. He said i sent a proposal to your parents now you can reply. Then I asked him do you want me to accept you at this emotional availability and he said yes. He didnt give me any solid answer about what are his plans about moving back to our country or anything. I asked him about his views on women and he had typical views that wives are supposed to cook and take care of the home and if she us working then its only for herself so she still has to manage house chores and etc. my world got flipped I couldn’t believe what I was hearing after two years of relationship with the guy. 

Everyone told me to accept the break up and just cut him off. But I still gave him the benefit of doubt I asked him if he was doing this because he was stressed from job search and can he think about it again. I tried to have conversations with him but he was just so rude and inconsiderate of my feelings that I had to stop the begging because i was hurting too much. I left it and just tried to accept the hurt and sit with my feelings alone without crying in front if him. He wouldn’t talk to me because he thought it was not okay in terms of religion but sometimes he would text or call me and we would have an argument that why he is doing what he is doing and then it would not yield a result. he clearly said that he wont make the things as they were but still wants to marry me. I couldn’t make sense of the fact that how he wants to marry me when he would not take my responsibility based on the technicality that he is not my husband yet. How he couldnt respect me to tell me about how I am not his gf anymore and how he is so insensitive to my crying in front of him. I waited for 2.5 months for him to realize, had multiple arguments with him but he was so avoidant and emotionally unavailable that he sent me money on a religious festival pretending that everything is fine. I didnt want his money as he didn’t want to be my bf and was hurting me continuously so I got so hurt that time that he doesn’t realize how serious it is for me and how hurt I am. I blocked him and told him to talk to my parents just as he wanted to handle the marriage related stuff. 

He got out of control and emailed me that he will text in the community group if I dont reply him. I was shaking worried about what he will say in that group and what people will think of me so I asked my sister to talk to him. They had an argument because the guy was acting unaware of the fact that him texting in the group could affect my reputation. He kept of forcing my sister to ask me to talk to him. I was having my final exams that week and I was so hurt an angry at him and scared of him that he can hurt me I didnt want to talk to him. My sister told him multiple times to wait for a week but he came to my door unannounced and I got so scared that he might hurt me if i opened it. I didnt talk to him.

I decided to deal with him on my own and unblocked him to talk to him. He said he realizes that he was emotionally unavailable and wants to get back. I said I am very hurt and I need time. He didnt stop i felt pressured and I couldn’t handle it. It was messy. He asked to meet and talk I said I am just not ready yet. He blocked me but then I had a weak moment and tried to talk to him. He unblocked me too. We talked on and off but then he went back to his family and then he started switching his narrative said. I think it was his family that said all this to him. He also started hitting how two of my sisters arent married and how his sisters are married so he knows how this marriage thing works and we are just handling it wrong. He asked for my pictures one day that I miss u. I got so hurt that he ended the whole freaking relationship with me on this argument and then is doing this unreligious behaviour still. Then he also started saying that he has been talking to girls just to know how people think and asked me to implement this “dating advice”. I got hurt that he is already talking to other girls but I didnt say much. Later on he started saying that since I have him blocked on socials, he doesn’t know what I am doing on there and he thinks that I am going on different gatherings and making male friends and he wont accept it. I stopped the conversation. He then later on said that its one of his “conditions” for marraige now that he wont accept any friendly interaction with any men of his wife. He wont compromise on his conditions now and I dont have any wife material qualities either but he accepted it before because he was in love and but this male interaction condition is something he wont accept anymore. He is so rude to me and still says that he loves me but says that I manipulate him, gaslight him whenever i try to talk with my emotions with him that he is so rude and is hurting me.

I dont know what happened to him, did i turn him into this man because the boy I knew with was so cute and jolly and now he is a different person? Was I too selfish with him and now I am getting what I sowed? Does he still loves me? All i wanted of him was to be patient with me in commitment and also when he wanted to get back, i was hurt I couldn’t handle my emotions and thoughts. I wanna know what went wrong?",1,1,2025-06-28 13:38:52,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmn1uf/self_accountability_required_or_the_guy_was/,,,"I don't think you did anything wrong. The guy was eventually going to stop being cute and jolly no matter what you did.  I don't think he loves you, although he would probably marry you if you agreed to submit to him."
Met The Love of My Life on a gaming app but I messed it up,"This was like a month long long distance relationship, we're countries apart. But distance never really mattered to us since we were so into each other. I used to mock people that had e-relationships but I went right into one unexpectedly that's how truly amazing as a person she is. She is perfect in every way. She made sure to put forward all her shortcomings(which imo barely counted as such) before going ahead w anything so I can know what I'm getting into. I truly do not believe I can find someone as good as her. We only knew each other for over a month but it was mostly just deep talks which went on for hours at end and it felt like I really knew her. She had past trauma which caused commitment issues due to which she hadn't even been interested in dating anyone for the last few years, but decided to open up to me. 

But at some point during our relationship I mentioned 2 incidents where I had unintentionally led on someone online who fell in love w me and I had to break their heart cus I did not love them back. This kinda reminded her of her past trauma which involved misleading so this was something she could not get past since it had taken her years to get over that trauma. She tried so hard to get over the misleading aspect and I absolutely love her for it but it always came back to haunt her when she was alone w her thoughts. She even said she could bear any other red flag be it me being homeless/broke or an ex convict but not what I did. She's the strongest person I know and surely she could not risk anything that could ruin her happiness, not after she has been through so much already. So after a few days she decided she can't take it and we broke up. 

We stopped talking to each other and she got off the gaming app, and a few weeks after that I was drunk and I got to talking to someone on the same app who is a friend. She asked for my snap and I complimented her story which had a selfie. She sent me a couple more pics(normal ones) and I complimented her more and passed a comment on the lines of 'being turned on while looking at her picture' which in hindsight was creepy as hell and i do not even remember saying it until she mentioned it 2 days later. I'm not justifying it by blaming it on the alcohol, maybe I probably would've still flirted w her if it wasn't for that.

Couple weeks later, my Baby came back to the gaming app and I stumbled across her and we got to talking again. She had decided earlier that she will avoid me once she gets back to the app but then she agreed to talk privately just one last time. We got to talking and it was nice just catching up, but then I mentioned that incident of me passing that comment on another girl and it got her so mad. She said she understands we had broken up but she didn't expect me to move on so soon and flirt w others already. She herself couldn't even think of entertaining any men all this while and here I am doing stuff like everything is normal. I tried to justify it initially but then I realised she's making super valid points and how messed up it was on my part to do what I did. And the thing is, I still had thoughts that somehow she could come back to me at some point after thinking things through, but even so, I decided to flirt w someone else during that time. I can't stop beating myself up and my mind is completely messed up rn. 

I was the first person in years that she decided to trust and I screwed it up before it barely began. She says my actions don't align with my words and in hindsight I have realised how true it is in some cases and have decided it's time for some deep introspection of my behaviour and work on it and make sure I think 100 times before doing anything that can hurt the other person even in the slightest way. I keep doing things that disappoint her, upsetting her more and more every time she takes the time to try and get over my previous actions. I could not sleep for so many hours that night when she actually cried because of what I did, but what good is regret when this could've been easily avoided if my dumbass actually thought about the consequences before even acting on something.

She truly deserves someone much better and I actually pray every day that she does, she really is such a pure soul and absolutely deserves every good thing in this world. I call myself an open book but sometimes what she read in my book totally threw her off and rightly so, the things I do sometimes are just so beyond inexplicable that I don't even realise what I'm doin until I've done it and that's something she can't risk getting into. Heck, she was even ready to change her religion for me(since mine is strict) and here I was taking it all for granted. I recently went to a different city for some religious meeting where 2 pretty girls seemed to show interest in me but I didn't even care,  I was still not over My Baby. But when it came to flirt w someone online I barely thought twice before doing it, even though I was drunk, and I feel so damn angry at myself for even trying to justify it to her. Goddddd if only I had put myself in her shoes before doing that to her, I could've avoided that incident. The only supposedly good thing to come out of that incident is probably that atleast doing that will make moving on from me much easier for her since I think she could not be any more disappointed in me. 

This may sound cliche but she truly makes me want to be a better person so as I begin my journey of being a better version of myself, I shall always keep her in my mind. Sometimes I try to think of negative things about her so it can help me move on better but trust me when I say I cannot think of a single thing cus she is literally just so perfect and I surely cannot match up to her, but thought that if she could give me one last chance I could show her that I'm willing to do what it takes to be my best self that she deserves, but she's not one to take risks in her personal or professional life which is so frustrating for me but totally understandable considering what she has been through in the past.  There are times when I don't think about her much but then so many things in my daily life keep reminding me of her, be it some TV show that mentions the city she lives in or any random cat I see irl or on my insta feed that reminds me of her cat, and my mind just goes spiraling back to thoughts of her. I still love her to death, My Gummy Bear 🤍 but I've realised like she said that my actions don't align w my words and I'm probably just a sweet talker but now I've promised myself to work on this and be more mindful of my actions and it's consequences on others and make sure I cannot hurt yet another person like I hurt My Baby.

Anyway I'm so sorry this is way too long but I just wanted to vent. Thank you to whoever decided to take the time to read everything.

I keep comparing every girl I see to my ex,"Hey everyone, I (21M) went through a tough breakup two months ago. Honestly, it left me heartbroken in a way I’d never experienced before.

Now when I’m out walking around or just hanging out, I see beautiful women, but none of them seem as beautiful as her. Not just physically, but emotionally too. I still find myself comparing them to my ex, not in a shallow way, but in how they *feel*. It’s like no one else makes the same kind of impact - she became this emotional reference point, and it’s been really hard to shake.

Sometimes I even feel guilty for noticing other women at all, because it just reminds me of how much I still miss her. And that makes me feel like something’s broken inside me - like I’ll never be able to love someone again without constantly measuring it against what I had (or thought I had) with her.

Has anyone else felt like this? How did you deal with it? How do you move forward when no one feels quite like *her*?",16,5,2025-06-27 21:59:33,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm6d6g/i_keep_comparing_every_girl_i_see_to_my_ex/,,,"I feel this too ,after the breakup / no contact - it’s like I’ve been doomed with this feeling of always seeing my ex in others , even if I don’t want it to be that way - I’m sure it’s Just the process of unresolved feelings and eventually that will subside ||| i would give it more time. 2 months is enough to start feeling better, but for me it wasn't nearly enough time to move onto a new person or relationship. id say focus on detaching from her still without needing to be with someone new yet. i didnt date someone for like a year after, and i still screwed up by dating the wrong person. you arent missing out on much man, the dating market is horrifyingly bad. focus on your own improvement, and let the next girl come when she does, no need to force anything ||| Been there and done that. Give it time sir. When you started dating again I was looking for women like her. I backed off and realized what I was doing.   I eventually found an amazing woman who rocked my world in the bedroom and was better looking than my ex. She’s also an amazing woman. ||| you’re not in love with *her*   you’re in love with a version of you that existed when you were with her   she’s just the emotional bookmark   what you’re grieving is the feeling   not the person  stop chasing replicas   start rebuilding you   when you stop needing to compare   someone new will stop feeling like a consolation prize ||| You are simply not ready to date again. You need to truly move on from her.  It takes time. It could be months, it could be years... But you owe to yourself and your prospective partner to move on before bringing someone else in."
Feeling guilty doing things without my ex,"Me and my ex officially ended things almost 2 weeks ago. I find myself feeling really guilty doing things without him. 

There’s shows, movies, video games, etc that releases that I feel like I should hold off on doing. I feel like I should hold off because i’m holding onto that hope that he will become a better person who holds himself accountable. I don’t know when this will be though, i wanted to at least wait a while in case real change was being made. 

It’s tough because these things release and we have been talking about it a LOT. So it feels so weird to go do these things without him when we had planned to do them together. I want to avoid spoilers for these things so bad too, but I’m so used to watching stuff the exact day they release. Now I feel like I can’t because I wanted to with my ex.

I would say watch the shows if you can manage to not be depressed during it ||| Same.  Made the mistake of coming to a festival we used to come together… man, i missed her, and I felg guilty (unfortunately, mos of the bands were ‘hers’) ||| Two weeks is just the start of the healing process.

Finally got/gave closure to this episode,"It has been a year and half since my breakup and few days back I got a phone call from her sister wishing me (We were close back then, totally Platonic). I was shocked ans shaken.

We broke up 2 days ago and I want to rant,"I’m scared my ex will see and read this because he might, but I want to post anyways. Hello if you do read this, it’s okay. We [23f and 20m] broke up 2 days ago.

I haven’t journaled or anything, I haven’t thought too much about it, I think I’ve avoided thinking because I’m terrified I will break completely. I’ve cried to my parents so much, but I haven’t cried on my own, I’m quite numb. So I’m posting here.

We lived together in a city I moved to for a job. We met 2 weeks into me living there and he had just moved there as well. It felt like fate. I only had him there. I didn’t make any friends, I never had any friends to begin with so it wasn’t unexpected. And the job I moved for turned out to be so soul sucking, so I started to hate it. But I was grateful I had him at least. We went on adventures together, even if I had a full-time job, even if he was unemployed and neither of us the most well-off. We made the most out of life and spent so much quality time together.

He was my everything, he was my best friend and the one I thought I would spend the rest of my life with. I was always scared I was too much because I was aware I didn’t have anyone else but him, but he made me so happy, he made me fulfilled, so I let myself be selfish. I know I relied on him too much and I wanted to change that in the future because I always wanted to work on myself. I have anxiety, life is hard for me, I always wanted to be better, and I thought he would support me to get there. I supported him when he felt down. When he started slacking on chores I didn’t complain (much) I just did them for him. I understood he had a lot going on and I wanted to support him when he was going through bad things.

We had so much fun together. We did everything together. We moved in together after like 3 months of knowing each other because I spent every day sleeping over at his place anyways, so it was already like living together. I knew this was crazy then, but I thought if we work out this is a cute story of how in love we were and how we knew from the very beginning it would be us.

He broke up with me because we’re too different. I agree we are, but I think it’s beautiful, I think it’s healthy. We got along great. We never fought, just had small disagreements. I knew there were some things that nagged on him and that he couldn’t get over. He didn’t want me to change for him, he just wished I was different to begin with. I guess he couldn’t accept me for me.

He always said he loved me more than I loved him but I always knew that wasn’t true, and now it’s confirmed. He is so different from me, but I understand the way his mind works, I can put myself in his brain and see the world from his perspective. I know he isn’t perfect, I know of his flaws, I can list so many of them, but they never mattered, I didn’t care because my love for him is greater than any petty flaw. I wished he would communicate with me more, that he would show his love more, that he would buy me flowers and that he would take an interest in my hobbies too. I could accept these things because I loved him and he was worth it, I didn’t want to change him, I didn’t care about his flaws. I was so willing to fight for us, I was so willing to communicate and work things out and do anything for him, ANYTHING, because that’s what you do when you love someone this much. You don’t give up. You just don’t give up for some imagined future you’re scared of. You don’t know the future, you can’t know this was the right decision.

He said he didn’t recognize who he was anymore. He’d started putting in less effort into things, he was getting lazier. I don’t think this was because of me, why would it be because of our relationship? I noticed him changing, I did everything I could, I tried to support him as best as I could. We didn’t have any problems, nothing noticeable, just this slow descent into some kind of sadness. We both had a lot going on. I had a lot weighing on me, and he did too. I think. This was our first challenge in the relationship and I thought we would stick together and make the other stronger. He just escaped. We never faced any challenges, and at the first *hint* of one he just gave up.

I know we would have worked out. I know in my very soul we could have had a beautiful life together. I don’t think just one person is your soulmate, so I don’t think he was my one and only, I think I could work with a lot of different people. And I know he was one of them. I know for a fact that the life we could have had together would have been a happy one. And now it’s just gone. Everything I thought I knew is just gone.

I think he’s scared. I think he is scared of commitment because of his childhood. I think he panics at the thought of being tied down. I think he will always break up with his partners because no one will be the perfect one for him, because no  person is perfect, and he will always find something wrong in everyone. No one handles the world exactly the way you do, no one has all the same interests that you do, no one will cope like you do and agree with you on everything. Especially since you’re a man and you want a woman, men and women work differently. I think he’s too young to understand the gravity of this decision. I think he will always chase something better. I’m selfish and I don’t think he understands how much I would do for him. I wouldn’t sacrifice myself for him, I wouldn’t forget who I am or become someone else for him, but I would do stuff for him because I know it would make him happy, I would consider anything. I would move to the other side of the planet for him, I would go on his adventures and endulge in his hobbies because it would make me understand him and because it would make us stronger as a couple. I would do things that make me scared if he was just there to help and support me. I still hope he will regret this and I hope it will haunt him. I hope he’ll see this pattern and realize he’s the problem.

I have started to accept things more now. But I still think he’s wrong. I still want to be with him and I would still do anything for him. I love him more than I ever loved anything else. I wanted a life with him. I wanted everything with him. And it hurts so much. I am so scared. I’m scared to be alone, I’m scared of how lonely I will be, I’m scared of how depressed I will be.

I’m so scared of my future. My whole life will turn upside down now. I hated my job and now I can’t bare to return. I can’t stand the thought of returning to that apartment to see every trace of him gone and to pack up my own stuff. I didn’t have anyone in that city except for him so I have no reason to stay. I’m moving home again to live with my parents. I will be unemployed and unhappy living at home again. It feels like so many steps backwards in my development. It feels like failure. And I can’t stand the thought of never seeing him again, of him being hours away and unreachable. I have no connection to that city and no reason to return, so this is it. He is completely gone forever. It is so harsh and so terrifying. It happened to fast. I can’t accept that this is it.",2,1,2025-06-28 09:19:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmikbh/we_broke_up_2_days_ago_and_i_want_to_rant/,,,👍

For all the people who got dumped by there ex you’re lucky if you don’t see them anymore,"Trust the fact that you don’t see or even you don’t know nothing about them,  would really help you to move on and always remember that you’re lucky. 
I got stuck with my ex in same environment, already one year passed and still more two years, sometimes you wish that you just can’t see them anymore everything would be more easier but sadly you will be there to discover all the lies all the hurt they cause you. 




Update (long story short):

I’ve been in a relationship with her for two years. She dumped me a year ago, but unfortunately, we’re still at the same university even in the same class.
The reason we broke up? She said she wanted to “find her life” and claimed she still loved me. I took care of every mess she went through, solving her problems while staying stuck with mine. Two years of giving pieces of myself, and getting nothing back.
The sad part started after the breakup. She dumped me, but she never wanted to leave me in peace. The most toxic person I’ve ever dated in my life. After the breakup, she told me, “Don’t ever talk to me again front of people.” I said, “Sure.” But then she started texting and calling me privately, even asking to go out as long as no one could see us. While I got tired of these behaviors, she began playing the victim and blaming the timing. When I accepted the breakup, she started acting like she owned me. And every time she felt like I was moving on, she would come back begging to get back together only to dump me again, just to feel like she had control. She treated everyone else kindly, except for me. In her mind, she owned me. I tried to set boundaries, to talk, to solve things. But for her, it was all just a game. When she felt lonely, she came back. She said awful things about me. She dated other men. She showed care for others. She betrayed me.
Even at the point where I lost my mind and said, “F*** all of this, I don’t want to see your f***ing face again,” she admitted that she was toxic and confessed all the bad things she did to me. She said, “Sorry for hurting you so bad.”
But the next morning? She came back and said, “Don’t call me again. I won’t talk to you anymore.”
That’s when I gave her a promise  that she would never hear from me again. Not for her, but for me. She had me hooked for seven months. But then I stopped everything and just focused on myself.
In the last two weeks, she tried to talk to me not once again in front of people calling my name pretending the kindness But she only heard my silence and that silence is forever. So i found out that the best thing i can do it’s just ignoreeeeeee with no reaction. So 

Sometimes, I just wish I hadn’t met here at the first time.

Sex tapes,I’ve been out of my relationship for about 3 years. I still have sex tapes of my ex and I. Within those 3 years I did get back into another relationship but I never watched my old sex tapes. Now I’m single again sometimes I get off to the sex tapes cause I find it better than porn.

Or should I not have those anymore?,0,4,2025-06-28 12:44:11,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmly1v/sex_tapes/,,,I think you know the answer to that. ||| Is there like an emotional attachment to her still? I’m only asking because my ex will watch porn since he’s gone to use drugs to deal with our breakup but I found that he watches our videos and or pics to you know…
THIS is how I got over it FAST!! (I wish I knew this years ago)🫣,"I don’t usually post stuff like this, but I know how many people here are struggling and I just wanted to share something that really helped me when I thought nothing would.

When my relationship ended, it hit me like a freight train. I genuinely thought I wouldn’t make it through. I couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep, and just kept replaying every conversation trying to figure out what I did wrong. 🫣

I remember one night, sitting on the kitchen floor at 2am sobbing, feeling like I would never stop missing him.

I tried everything ~ the gym, meditation, talking to friends, reading every breakup book I could find ~ and while all of it helped a little, there was one thing that honestly helped me the most.

It was this journal called [Break Up with Your Heartbreak](https://amzn.to/3FJtSyu). It wasn’t just a book to read, it was something I could do. It guided me through 30 days of writing stuff out, getting all the pain out of my system. It kind of became my little safe space. I didn’t expect much from it but it honestly helped more than anything else I tried.

If you’re going through it right now, I just want to say ~ you will get through it. Even if it doesn’t feel like it. You’re not broken, you’re just heartbroken. And that’s something that can heal.

Sending love to anyone who needs it today.

HOW DO I MAKE THIS FEELING DIE?,"Less than a month into our breakup they were already with somebody else. It shattered my soul, yet it’s been 4 months already AND I JUST LOVE HER STILL. 

I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I don’t see anything in social media about them. I haven’t seen them ever since we broke up. I have absolutely zero contact with them. Despite all of my efforts I just can’t get her out of my head. Please I’m desperate, I’m begging, just leave me alone, leave my mind already.

I feel so stupid, I mean I must be, since after everything they could’ve done to destroy me I just can’t seem to hate her. In my mind I just forgave her, told myself that it was fine, because there is no room in my heart for hate towards her… 

But right now, I’m just so tired. Tired of caring, tired of loving her, tired of thinking about her. I just don’t know what to do anymore…",20,14,2025-06-27 20:17:40,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm3yy4/how_do_i_make_this_feeling_die/,,,"same thing bro ||| It is my nightmare.

And to this day I still take pictures of things she would like or think is cool without even thinking about it.  Even though she’s already with somebody else it just sucks so much ||| Gotta look at it as a win man. Think of her finding someone else that quickly as a clear sign it was never going to work between you two. You valued your relationship more. Now you can fully move on and accept it. Be strong bro ||| Same thing dude. We broke up like a month and a half ago. I was doing okay until week 2-3 where she became exclusive with someone else. Shit hurts so much even though it’s a rebound and will probably crash and die at some point. Or maybe it won’t. It feels like I’m losing her, like there really is no hope ever again, which is what she said. Like my life is over. I fucked up no contact, she said she missed me and how sad she is without me and how gross it feels to say that to me while dating a new guy. Blocked me for her own sanity. That we can never try again.  One thing that seems counterintuitive but helps me when I realize i’m getting really anxious is thinking about how i have no control to change it. Worrying doesn’t give me more control, it’s an obstacle. Being sad and wondering about them gives me no more control, it’s a road block. It does nothing positive for me for getting back the relationship or for my recovery. The anxiety stems from me feeling like I need to be doing more, like she’s slipping away, like my life is going to end, like if I stop thinking about her I won’t come up with the solution or that if I keep worrying and thinking I’ll find how to heal.. HAVE to be doing more right, I have to do something… But I am already doing everything in my power, which is nothing. Nothing more for me to be doing to get them back/get over them than do nothing. I have to do nothing. Just live my life and try to enjoy it. Nothing to text to her. There is absolutely nothing I can do besides wait. You’re literally doing everything that you can towards her right now, which is nothing. Doing nothing about it is correct even though your body says otherwise. You are doing the correct thing by doing nothing. You got this man. Just wait it out and tell the anxiety that nothing is key.  But not in the literal sense. Just in regard to giving it your energy by obsessing, worrying, replaying, thinking of it. if you’re not working on yourself I would recommend it. Gives you things to focus on. I’m fixing my health, getting medicated for anxiety/depression, therapy, working on my avoidant attachment, learning how to communicate more effectively. ||| you don’t love her   you love the version you built in your head   and that version never dumped you for someone else  your brain’s just stuck on the habit loop   you’re not heartbroken, you’re addicted  you kill the feeling by starving it   not by fighting it   no texts   no stalking   no imaginary convos   no “what if” rewrites  she’s gone   let the fantasy die too ||| There's a reason why hate is a common reaction to such situations. To keep loving is dangerous, to hate is safe.  Burn down every memento of her, hate her, corrupt every single memory. See her as a monster, a parasite, a demon... Whatever you need to do to free yourself from the shackles of misguided love.   You can only have control over yourself and your mind and you need to reclaim it, by right of conquest if you must."
My Ex new BF or Husband is a manager at my workplace.,"So I have been thinking about even posting this for a while. Its honestly not a recent break up but it is weird and I've been thinking about this for a while. In 2020 my GF of 3.5 years broke up with me. We had a bad break up. (Both names on the lease on the apartment, she didnt want to sign to break the lease, etc.). Acouple years later,I find put her new BF (baby daddy apparently/husband maybe, dont know, dude had like 3 or 4 kids before she got with him) is a manager at my plant I work at. I've worked there for 10 years now. So, she knows I work there. In fact we met at the same factory. I'm over her now pretty much totally and have had encounters with this guy. Whether he knows who I am or I know who he is. Most likely he knows who I am. But some years ago I was still caught up on her and when I realized who he was, it did bother me a bit. The point of this post is wtf, how did this guy end up here? Was it directed at me, or was she just trying to get her new man a job. It just seems weird to me for him to show up as a manager at my new job. Like she was trying to take a jab at me.",1,0,2025-06-28 12:32:05,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmlpo2/my_ex_new_bf_or_husband_is_a_manager_at_my/,,10 year(s),
OMG I Cracked it!!! THIS is the secret to getting over them INSTANTLY!! (It works👏🏻👏🏻),"I’ve CRACKED it. Seriously. After years of heartbreak, therapy, crying over people who gave less than zero shits about me, I’ve finally figured out the secret trick to getting over someone instantly.

You ready?

Are you sure? 

Really?? 

Ok … Here goes … 

“Become completely repulsed by anyone who treats you badly.”

Not just annoyed. Not just hurt. Not just disappointed.

REPULSED.!!!!

I’m talking stomach-turning, eye-rolling, immediate switch-off energy when someone doesn’t do right by you. Whether it’s a partner, a friend, your boss, your family ~ if they can’t treat you with basic decency and respect, that’s your sign to mentally bin them.

Because here’s the truth: We’ve been conditioned to tolerate poor behaviour. To over-explain ourselves. To make excuses for people’s lack of effort or kindness. To tell ourselves they’re “just going through something” or “don’t know how to love properly.”

Screw that.

The second you flip the switch from “Why don’t they love me?” to “Why the hell am I trying to get love from someone who treats me like this?” ~ that’s the moment you win. That’s the moment you get your power back. That’s when the obsession dies.

Want proof? I’ll give you a story … 

There was this guy I was hung up on for months. We weren’t even officially together, but the way I thought about him ~ you’d think I was mourning a soulmate. He breadcrumbed me. Ghosted me then came back with a “Sorry I’ve just been busy.” He never made solid plans, never showed up emotionally, and made me feel like I had to earn the bare minimum.

And I ate it up. I kept telling myself he was “damaged” and that if I just loved him harder, he’d finally see I was the one.

One night I was crying into my pillow over him (again), and something in me just snapped. I suddenly saw it clearly: I was obsessing over someone who didn’t deserve the steam of my piss.

I reread all his messages. The flakiness. The one-word replies. The way he made me feel like a side dish in his life. Instead of feeling sad, I felt sick.

This man wasn’t mysterious. He wasn’t special. He wasn’t broken. He was just a lazy, emotionally unavailable man who was never going to choose me ~ not properly. Not fully. And I had been giving my soul to that. Wasting months of my life waiting for crumbs when I deserved the whole cake.

Once I let myself get repulsed instead of heartbroken, the spell broke. Completely. Like flipping a switch. I went from crying over him to laughing at the fact I ever wanted him. I could’ve written a novel on the fantasies I built in my head about someone who gave me nothing to work with.

There’s a book I picked up around that time called [Rejection Breeds Obsession](https://amzn.to/4kbuECN), and holy shit ~ it explained everything. It laid it out so clearly. I wasn’t in love. I was addicted to the feeling of rejection. I was chasing validation from someone who didn’t have the capacity to give it, because deep down I thought I needed them to prove I was worthy.

Spoiler: I don’t. You don’t. None of us do.

That magical book helped me realise I was in a twisted emotional loop, craving a hit of approval from someone who never actually saw me. Once I saw it for what it was ~ that they weren’t special, I had just made them special ~ I snapped out of it.

So here it is again, for the people in the back:

The fastest way to get over someone? Start being disgusted by people who treat you like shit. Stop being flattered by crumbs. Start being offended.

They are not rare. They are not your twin flame. They are just someone who couldn’t do the bare minimum, and you’ve been wearing heartbreak goggles and calling it love.

Never again.

Loving from afar,"My ex and I broke up around five months ago after we broke each other's boundaries and were arguing on and off for a few weeks leading up to it. After two months no contact, I messaged her and we met up to try and iron things out and see if there's anything left in the tank. We both expressed how much we love each other and how we want to be together til the very end. We expressed how sorry we were for the hurt we caused and that we were stupid for even going no contact in the first place. It seemed like we were on the path toward rebuilding, but a few days later I met up with her and we both had a feeling that we were going to try and restart things. Because of that she wanted to be honest with me, and she told me that she started talking to someone about a week or so prior to me breaking no contact. They never went on date or anything, all they did was talk on the phone once or twice (small talk and icebreakers nothing crazy) and text each other from time to time. She claimed she had no feelings for him and felt that she just needed to snap out the depression of missing me by venturing out. Looking back at it now she did absolutely nothing wrong, all she was trying to do was move on because she thought that I was over her since I was the one who initiated no contact. Unfortunately in that moment when she told me about it I broke down and felt betrayed because I just couldn't imagine how someone could call me the love of their life but then proceed to talk to another person less than two months post break up. My break down caused everything to fall apart again and we spent hours crying in each others arms wishing none of this ever happened. The next day she made the judgment call of ending things for good. She told me how much she loves me and how deep down she does believe we were meant to be together, but she felt the relationship was taking too much of a toll on our mental well beings and that continuing with it would make the relationship toxic. She didn't want us to drag each other down and end up resenting down the line, so she wanted to end it while there was still love. I didn't fight it because her previous ex always pressured her into staying no matter how many times she tried ending things, and I didn't want her to feel stuck again and relive those traumas. We both ended it with our last words being I love you. 

It's been three months since that and I mourn this relationship just as much as I did at the start of the year. Not an hour goes by where I don't think about her. I've tried a handful of things. I've been going to therapy twice a week for the last four months, going to the gym, learning the guitar and piano, traveling, drawing, journaling, and distracting myself with my friends. No matter how hard I try, I find myself thinking about her and falling into a depression. Nothing I do makes me feel remotely as good or happy than when I was with her. She truly was the missing piece to my puzzle. I never felt more loved, I never felt more comfort, I never slept so well, and I never felt more motivated. I'd look into her eyes and see the most beautiful soul ever. I saw my future wife, my best friend, and my biggest supporter and now all I can do is love from afar.

I've found myself constantly getting thrown into loops that make this process of moving on that much more difficult. About a month and a half ago one of my coworkers showed me an instagram story of my ex writing about how much she misses me. Then about two weeks ago, one of my friends posted my grad photos on his instagram story and she liked the story. My friend asked her why she liked it and she told him that she felt extremely happy for me and proud of all the work I put in, but she also reassured him that we are broken up for good and asked him not to tell me that she liked his story because she didn't want me overthinking things (which obvs he didn't). Although it hurts, I do feel extremely grateful that she's happy and proud of me because without her support I wouldn't have been able to get through college, and her support will always mean the world to me. It doesn't make me angry that she doesn't want me to know, in fact I don't feel much anger about anything. When I look back at what lead to us breaking up five months ago I don't hold that same anger anymore, instead I've been learning to understand our actions, and I find myself wishing things turned out differently.

There's no doubt in my mind that my love for her is true. I've been wanting to ask her to get lunch some time, not even to get on my knees and beg for her to come back, but to just see her again and see how she is doing. I've been restraining myself from asking because I don't want to bother her and cause any distress. I've also restrained because I'm not sure if I can separate the emotion I feel for her if we were to talk. My heart tells me I should, my head says don't and I'm sure everyone will agree with my head. All I've heard over the last five months is that time heals and the more people say it the more it frustrates me because time has not been on my side and it feels like it never will. I wish love wasn't so complicated, I wish love was enough, and I wish I didn't have to love from afar.",4,0,2025-06-28 04:55:10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmei0q/loving_from_afar/,,,
I wish I did more things.,"He broke up with me a week ago over text, we haven’t had contact since then.
He complained about our sex life every so often, and now I think, If I just did it with him more often, maybe he would stayed? I’m feeling lots of feelings of guilt.

breakup with an female avoidant,"Met a girl 29F and im 28m and we were going out for four months which isnt the longest period of time. everything from the get go was perfect or so i thought , she had this hot and cold behaviour which was also self sabotaging. She would always reschedule dates based on her mood and a few times would self sabotage herself early on. from what i understand by the end of our relationship is that she would try come up with any reason to leave at certain points in our relationship but her parents/friends would help her get past her self sabotaging behaviours so it continued. Keep in mind throughout most of our dating she would act like she was head over heels in love with me.

also for context she had issues with her father growing up , and also her parents split up for a certain period of time which im assuming is the causes of her avoidant behaviours.

  
the craziest part for me is we had a weekend getaway planned , the day before the weekend getaway she had told me she just cried because i was the best thing to ever happen in her life and was talking about buying a house in the future. que 24-48 hours we are on the rocks and the vibe has completely changed. she started picking my life apart and started to tear me down and gaslight me in very subtle ways. then the conversation turned into not feeling a spark/ romantic connection and i was the reason to blame for various reasons like that "" i had a wall up"" or im too reserved. Im no perfect person but i always take feed back and try to improve myself as a person. anyway no answer or response that i gave was good enough for her , she had basically moved on in her mind and was looking for an escape.

I did have gut feelings at certain points in the relationship that some things werent normal , but i looked past it because she checked alot of boxes and would take accountability ( but she would not change her behaviour in hindsight)

Throughout everything i held myself composed and calm and collected for the most part. I probably could have called her out more at certain points but i didnt.

it ended over text then and i just told her best of luck and didnt beg or cry. now its been a week of no contact. From what i understand by reading other reddits threads. avoidant people tend to comeback alot ?  or they text just to check in. so i would be interested to see if she does. she obviously has alot of trauma causing her behavoiurs which i could see she was working on but shes not there yet. im not sure i would take her back based on everything that has happend and taking advice from other people. I wont lie im very curious if she is going to reach out to me again.

this was my first experience with a girl like this and while it was one of the best experiences for me , alot of the behaviours i experienced arent normal in a relationship that should be easy and fun.  




  
",1,6,2025-06-28 12:21:54,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmlizg/breakup_with_an_female_avoidant/,,,"I’d suggest doing whatever will make you ultimately ok with either outcome…that she does or does not reach out.  Also let’s say she calls next week.  Her behavior isn’t an active choice really, she’s hard wired by difficult experiences to go into protective mode.  It’s likely she’ll do this until she’s very aware of it, and in therapy to actively change the way she shows up in relationships.  That doesn’t mean the feelings you had or saw from here were not real, and it seems she cared a lot about you.  She just can’t sustain a relationship with all of the ingredients.  Can you tell I’m in it/been there?"
"Me [23/F] with my partner [24/M] — we started dating 5 weeks after my breakup, it feels amazing but maybe too fast?","Hello I 23F broke up with my partner of 2 years on May 29. It was a serious relationship, and I’ve been processing a lot since then. About 5 weeks later, I met someone new 22M (June 18), and we started dating around June 23–24.

We’ve quickly grown very close. Spending lots and lots of time together every day, talk about future visits and even children. This is his first serious relationship, while it’s not mine.

I feel really safe, heard, and connected, but my gut also says, “Is this moving too fast? Is it too good to be true?” I told him this, and he said he feels the same but encouraged me not to overthink.

I’m trying to stay grounded and intentional, but it’s hard with all these intense feelings and excitement. We’ve been vulnerable emotionally and sexually, and it feels special.

Here are some questions I’m thinking of asking him to deepen our connection and keep things real.

1. What does a healthy, lasting relationship look like to you?


2. How do you usually handle conflict or misunderstandings with someone you care about?


3. What’s something you’re working on within yourself right now?


4. What kind of support do you need when life gets stressful?


5. If we were to visit each other, what would an ideal first visit look like for you?



Reddit, do you think I’m moving too fast? How do I balance excitement with caution in a new relationship, especially early on? Any advice or personal stories would be appreciated.

Thanks so much!

It's been 10 months since the BU. after almost decade together I think about her everyday and miss her....but...I have not reached out at all. How come? Probably a mix of things, ego, pride, don't want to have to deal with the emotions. In my mind it's easier to detach and move on as I see no future with her.  So to her, I look like I have no regret and moved on. In a sense I have, but not fully since I do think about her. It's a mindset I have, maybe a way to protect myself. So, yes we do think about the person and may have regrets, we just avoid acting on anything sometimes. ||| I’ve done lots of study on this, since my ex blindsided me with a discard TEXT 15 months ago… (and ghosted me refusing to meet or talk).. they very well may experience pain and regret but expressing it, especially to their ex, or in public required a level or vulnerability and accountability, that they are almost pathologically allergic to… I’m sure that my ex felt “bad” about hurting me, but could she talk to me… Nope…. They don’t just move on… they shut down….. ||| Let go. ||| Well, mine said she had deep feelings but she could never use the L word and she could never live with a man in the same room or sleep in the same bed or keep her eyes open during sex or travel faster than slow. I had to come to her place, her bed, her world bed for sex when i suited her only, and then go home....  You have no idea how lonely that was.   It made me walk away from her because I was being used.  She said she never saw it coming and learned that she could last more than 3 months without ""running"" but that is because I understood her and made myself smaller to allow her to flourish.  Being told there was never going to be a life partner future and she would go traveling on her own one day... I just couldn't waste my latter years on that.  She was a dismissive autistic avoidant in her  own words. She knew it but she wanted companionship so badly. She said she was  fully committed long term and wasn't playing games But the definition of that  we differed on and i don't think she could understand relationships due to her autism.   She was a genius.  She told me upfront that her heart was closed and warned me... but she also said she was working on it and believed she had promise. She was a tragic soul with low self esteem and fear of people. Fiercely independent like all avoidants.  I got burned to a cinder. I fell sooo hard for her, her mind, her body and her kids.... I left to save myself.   How tragic is this. She's never coming back and I can't go back without destroying myself... Im sure she feels pain, but as to whether it is lasting as long as mine, i hope for her sake she's in agony, enough to make her get the help she needs so that she finds true love in a secure relationship one day. ||| So I am in a similar situation. I'm not sure the guy even cared. He dated me for three months and then dumped by text out of the blue and I never responded/ spoke to him again. I don't think he will return or regrets this, so who's to say they have pain or regret dumping us ? ||| When they come back, it's usually because their next relationship failed.  If they apologize, it's usually just a front for more emotional manipulation. They're just saying what you want to hear so that you'll agree to take them back. Then they'll stick around until the next time they feel like discarding you. ||| Avoidants do not exist as a separate category of people. His past has nothing to do with his attitude towards you. Avoidant = low interest in you, Anxious = high interest in you. The truth is, he's never interested you that much. Sorry, we've all been there, but admitting the truth is the first step"
a sustainable longterm partner will not give u ups and downs and be hot and cold — leave that for your teen years!,"your longterm partner should be reliable, honest, dependable, and most importantly available and open to solving issues when it gets tough. The minute you find your partner to be the type that withdraws when conflict arises and pretty much leaves you alone to deal with the pain or the consequences .. that’s not your reliable future sweetheart it just isn’t. That’s a shipwreck waiting to happen. It’s nothing but trouble trust me from experience. If they’re easy to walk away from conflict the first time they’ll do it a 100 times again so you see it and know it for sure. Do not settle just because they’re very attractive to you and just because you love them so much and just because you get along so well. What’s that gotten you? What’s the point of the good amazing times if when things get dark they ignore you, they let you deal with the pain on your own… that’s not a good partner, that’s a good fling, maybe LOL good for something, but not good for your safe and sustainable future.

About 5 weeks later, I met someone new [24/M] and we started dating around June 23–24. Things have moved quickly. We’re spending tons of time together every day, talking about future visits, and even kids one day.

This is his first serious relationship. It’s not mine. That alone is something I’m trying to be mindful of. how that difference in experience could impact us. Still, I feel incredibly safe, heard, and emotionally connected to him. We talk for hours, we laugh, we play games, we stream movies together. there’s a real bond forming. We’ve even been physically vulnerable together.

He picks up on little things I say and remember things about me that most people overlook. He genuinely seems to care. The way he listens and connects with me gives me butterflies.

But at the same time… I’m torn.
My gut is saying yes, this is good, go for it.
My mind is saying, wait—slow down, don’t get swept up.

I’ve told him it feels “too good to be true,” and he’s said he feels the same. He’s reassured me not to overthink, and he hasn’t pressured me in any way.

I’m trying to approach this intentionally while still staying open to what could be something great. I’ve been thinking of asking him deeper questions to help us stay grounded, like:

What does a healthy relationship look like to you?

How do you deal with conflict?

What are you working on within yourself?

What kind of support do you need when you’re stressed?

What would an ideal first visit look like for you?


I really want to make sure I’m not rushing in too fast. I’m good at reading people, and I usually trust my gut—but this is all happening so fast that I feel like I need a sanity check.",1,4,2025-06-28 12:14:47,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmleat/me_23f_with_my_partner_22m_we_started_dating_5/,,,"I prefer letting myself grieve first then get into a relationship. It feels good yes but you still need more time with yourself and your recovery. What happens if you lose him? You're gonna grieve 2 relationships . What happens if your relationship goes unstable? You're gonna deal 2 or more problems at the same time. As I said I think it's better to take your own time to recover and enjoy yourself. Please don't rush it. ||| From experience, I would say you need at least a few months alone to really grieve the old relationship, otherwise, if this one ends, you’re gonna be grieving 2 relationships instead of one. I had a lot of unresolved trauma from the first relationship that I carried into my second, and I didn’t start dating him until like 5 months after the breakup, so I think more time is better. Obviously, there’s always exceptions. Only you know best what you feel and what the relationship is really like. I would also say be weary of potential love bombing, if you feel swept away and like it’s going too fast, then it probably is. Being swept away can also stop you from seeing small potential red flags, so I’d say slowing down can only be a good thing. If your partner doesn’t respect that then that’s a red flag, but from what you’ve said, it sounds like he’d be okay with it. There’s no rush!"
still fresh and no contact is not going well,"my bf (m23) and i (f22) were together for 3 years and he broke up with me 6 days ago. 

nothing terrible. no cheating or anything but we argue a lot. it’s our first relationship and we were both trying to figure ourselves out whilst trying to be best for the other person and it took a toll on both of us. especially him, he couldn’t deal with my excessive emotions anymore and felt like he couldn’t see himself being in a relationship and then marriage like that, so he broke up with me. 

it hurts really bad but at the same time, i understand. we weren’t healthy for each other anymore and we were both eroding ourselves trying to be what the other person wanted. we still both love each other very much but a relationship isn’t working. 

i took 3 days off work to really feel my emotions (as people recommended) and by the 3rd day, i hadn’t eaten, slept, showered and i eventually called his mum in tears. she poured into me and helped me look after myself and really spoke my life into me. Now it’s been 6 days and for the first 3 days, when i would reach out, he would respond but i noticed that he never made the effort to check in even though we agreed to stay friends. this hurt me because throughout the relationship, i begged him to show me he cares about me and check in on me when im struggling. 

I then stopped reaching out and his last two responses are left unopened because i can’t keep trying to continue a conversation that may not be meant to happen. it’s now been 2 days of no contact, because i haven’t reached out and im just trying to push through and continue with my life and not put my life on hold because of this. this is my first heartbreak and i am in agony. 

i’m supposed to be going to an event with my friends next weekend and it was already pre planned and i took time off of work for it, but i know that he’s going to be there because he’s one of the organisers. How am i supposed to face him knowing that we are doing involuntary no-contact? 
how am i supposed to face him knowing that he gave up on us and doesn’t want me anymore? 

he mentioned something about both of us healing and coming back together but i don’t want to give myself any hope of that happening because i want to grieve and heal properly. in case he changes his mind and that doesn’t happen, i don’t want to hold on to hope of us being together again.

Is this too bad for him to forgive and return to me...,"Hello so for a little context me (24f) and my (25m ex) boyfriend? Ended up finding out I was 6 weeks pregnant it wasn't planned he lived in a shelter and I had just recently got housed. A few days before we found out this we were already struggling from a previous argument involving his new friend who seemed to like him more than a friend. 

I was struggling throughout the whole thing and he made promises and remarks he couldn't uphold which are at my insecurity of being abandoned. Now sometime during this he told me he had to contemplate having a relationship with me and he was only focusing on my health and not our relationship. while I was sick and pregnant he came over three times once because I went over there and demanded he comes like he said he would and the others well. 


Fast forward about 7 week mark of pregnancy I was hospitalized for dangerously low blood sugar freaking out about almost dying and my lack of support in my relationship and still reeling from ""yes we are in a relationship"" and ""I love you"" to ""contemplating I ended up doing something desperately. He said he would talk about us after I got my medical situation done so I lied and told him the hospital did the procedure to rid of the placenta so I wanted him to tell me what we were to each other.


 He said he's breaking things because of this lie and manipulation tactic plus mood swings and insecurities of others. I fucked up bad this time didn't I? Will he come back and hold onto a new relationship with me so we can grow together again? or is it just..... done.


 I know it was an evil thing to lie about and I will never forgive myself until you snap out of it. I also apologized to him but he doesn't respond probably not ever.",1,2,2025-06-28 12:01:22,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lml5dz/is_this_too_bad_for_him_to_forgive_and_return_to/,,,"Wait so are you still pregnant or not?

 it obviously didnt work out with her cause he tried coming back, but I ignored him, now hes spreading lies about me, he may have been all along, I dont gossip so havnt said anything bad about him to anyone.

Any advice? Ive been healing so well dont want to even participate in any of the drama.

3 year relationship just ended,"I posted here  few days ago but I don't even know what to do anymore

When do the doubts stop? Will they ever?,"I (f26) broke up with my bf (m27) of three years 7 weeks ago even though there was love. We were sadly just incompatible, having the SAME issues again and again and again, my needs weren’t met. And we did really try, both of us. He also had doubts in the end which he communicated very very badly and caused me lots of pain. I had to end it because it affected my mental and physical well-being (not sleeping, eating, stressed etc.). Feel free to look at my post about it in AIO for more details if you’re interested. 

The hardest part atm though? That I am doubting my decision. I know he is struggling and wants me back. That breaks me and makes it harder I think. In the beginning my gut feeling about having made the right decision was strong. And looking into the notes of my phone I had made over the years I see that I was ignoring personal “red flags” from the beginning on and the issues kept on going for three years.

Still the last 1 1/2 weeks that gut feeling just got weaker. I feel like I can’t trust myself anymore. There were lots of triggers for me the last week (being at a concert of a band I first went to with him, going to the street where he lives, his mom writing me and more), maybe that’s why. But that feeling is so so hard to handle. I find myself thinking: maybe we could’ve made it work. Maybe he changed now. Maybe he is THE ONE. I know I sound delusional, but I just can’t help it.

What can I do? How did you get over your doubts of breaking up if you had any? When did it get better? At what moment do I know it’s maybe right to go back? So many questions",2,0,2025-06-28 08:04:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmhh8r/when_do_the_doubts_stop_will_they_ever/,,,
Some days are just hard,"I’m coming up to 3 months post-break up after my 8 year relationship came to an end fairly suddenly. Life’s been a bit of a mess since, currently staying with my sister until I can find my own place, looking for ways to get a new social circle, which is a challenge in itself being a 41 year old guy with social anxiety, but I digress.
I’ve been focusing on myself, eating better, hitting the gym a lot, playing new games instead of the same ones over and over, and I have to admit, it does get easier. That’s not to say I’m happy, because I’m not. I haven’t felt genuine happiness in a long time. I was in a very very dark place just after being dumped, it absolutely broke me. I even went as far as to make a plan to end it all because the pain was unbearable. But I got help, and I’m still here today. 
Anyway, the reason I’m writing here is because I really thought I was getting a lid on it, but the last couple of days, I’ve been really thinking about her, wondering if she’s thinking of me, wondering what she’s up to, if she’s happy. And I just felt overwhelmed with emotions. I cried and cried, and I just needed to let it out.
It’s very much a case of 2 steps forward, 1 step back. Sometimes it’s 2 steps back. Today it feels like 3. 
Trying to create a new narrative is hard, but I have to hold out hope that it’ll continue to get easier.

Why do I still feel broken even after learning he was married? I just want to feel better.,"We broke up in October. It’s been 8 months, and I’ve tried to move on in every way — gym, eating well, working, focusing on myself. But even now, I just found out that he was married all along. And somehow… that truth doesn’t make me feel better.

The thing is, I had a hunch the entire time. I asked him multiple times if he was married — and every time, he got defensive or annoyed. He said all the “right” things to keep me around. He acted like he cared. He even claimed he’d been cheated on by all his exes and said he hated dishonesty in relationships. He painted himself as a victim of women who had wronged him — only for me to later find out he was married the whole time, and even has a two-year-old daughter.

It’s so crazy how people like this flip the story. He made me feel like I was too intense, too suspicious, too much. But my gut was right.

And yet… that still doesn’t give me closure. I keep thinking about him. I still cry. I still replay it all. I don’t want revenge. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s life. I just want peace. I want to stop feeling like this. It’s like no matter how much I realize he was a liar — it still hurts.",2,2,2025-06-28 08:00:56,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmhfgi/why_do_i_still_feel_broken_even_after_learning_he/,,,"Never ignore your gut.Especially when it comes to men.I know it hurts but take some time to heal.Also any guy who refuses to take accountability and calls all his exes crazy is usually the crazy one himself. Dont bother confronting men when they lie.They will lie , deny and play dumb. If your hunch is strong, just move on. Please take some time to work on your hobbies, focus on friends. I would also recommend reading about male psychology and watching videos about how men think when dating. It will definitely help you."
I feel like I’m going insane over a break up I thought I wanted to & now I’m drowning.plz help,"I don’t even know where to begin. I feel like I’m mentally falling apart, and I can’t seem to get back on my feet.

I (F, 22)recently went through a breakup with my bf (M,29) that has completely wrecked me and the worst part is, I was the one who originally pushed for it.
I wasn’t happy in the relationship. My needs weren’t met emotionally, relationally and I often dismissed, or like I was asking for too much.
I didn’t feel safe or supported in a consistent way.

There were moments of intensity, grand gestures (he once drove from San Francisco to LA to support me at a race), moments where he did show up when I was breaking down and those kept me believing it could work. But between the dramatic reconciliations, the daily reality left me hurting and confused.

So I tried to leave. Not because I didn’t love him but because I was trying to love myself more than I ever had before.
But every time I walked away, he’d come back somehow call me, show up at my house, make me believe he cared. And it felt like proof that I mattered, so I stayed. Or half-stayed.

I was stuck in this push-and-pull cycle where I didn’t know what was love and what was survival. I think he wasn’t a bad person, but I truly don’t believe he could meet me emotionally.
He’d say I overwhelmed him. He’d make me feel like I was unstable or too much. And honestly? I am intense. I feel deeply. I have mental health struggles and I was open about them.

Then came the final break.
This time, he was the one who agreed that maybe we shouldn’t try anymore. And that’s when something inside me completely collapsed.

I don’t eat properly.( have already lost 6kg)
I cry almost every day and have panic attacks & just over consume sleeping pills 
I can’t enjoy anything.
Summer is slipping away like a nightmare I can’t wake up from.
My family is scared for me. I feel like I’ve become a burden.
I can’t work, focus, or feel joy.
I go from blocking him on everything to checking obsessively.
Every time I try to create space, he pops back in with a like, a message, something and I spiral all over again.
It’s like he has a radar for when I’m starting to find the tiniest stability again, and that’s when he reappears not to get back together, not to offer clarity, but just enough to keep my heart cracked open.

And I get mad at myself, because I didn’t even feel truly happy in the relationship. I knew it wasn’t enough. So why now do I feel like I’m dying without it?

Why do I keep humiliating myself, begging him to talk, sending desperate messages, feeling like I’ve lost all dignity?
Why do I feel so mentally ill when I know this wasn’t good for me?

I blocked him everywhere a few days ago. Again. And now I’m sitting in this silence, afraid I won’t survive it.

I don’t know what I want from this post except maybe to feel less alone.
I’m scared that I’ve crossed some emotional line and I’ll never recover.
I can’t get back to my life.
I don’t feel like myself.
I’m grieving something I thought I chose.

Please, if anyone’s been through something similar how did you survive this?
How did you trust yourself again?
How did you stop craving someone who couldn’t love you the way you needed?

Because right now, it feels like I’m broken beyond repair.

Don’t try to measure it.   I asked that question so often. Eventually, you just start feeling different.  Life gets quieter. You get used to their absence. Your routines start to go back to normal. You think about them often but theirs gaps where your mind is occupied on something else.  Time continues on and it’ll hurt in moments. Healing will go up and down where it’s harder for a couple months and not as painful for the next ones. Healing will never be linear. Even 9 months from now and late nights get me.  I didn’t think I’d even make it because it was so painful, but I did. What has helped me is acceptance and occupying my mind.   I accepted that I did what I could. That I still have feelings but if something were to happen it would have, and that’s okay. To accept that I deserve love and happiness. That it will come to me, but only when I allow it and don’t chase too hard after it.  Occupying my mind by doing my favorite hobbies has helped. I have went tanning (safely) often and it’s helped more than anything. Just enjoying being outside in the sun while listening to my favorite music makes my day brighter. I also try to redirect my thinking. If I think of maybes or what ifs I try to shake myself out of it and find something else to focus on, whether it be a different perspective, event, idea, etc.   I’m sorry you’re going through pain. Many of us have experienced similar things. It’s important to know that you aren’t alone. It will take time and there’s no skipping that unfortunately. But from my own experience, the feeling of accomplishment is worth it. To know that you did it on your own. That you made it through those difficult times and are on to new things.   I hope things get better for you. Please stay strong. Be kind to yourself ❤️"
Heartbreak,"I think I need to write something down to help me feel better. 
My ex has informed me he has a new gf and she will eventually meet our child and I feel devastated. 
It’s been a long time since we have been a couple but idk maybe I was holding out hope that he would change and become the person I wanted him to be? It’s a hard pill to swallow that this stranger will get the version of him I kept asking to have for our family and it’s even harder to take that she will meet my child eventually. It’s hit me a lot harder than I’ve expected and I just don’t know how to get over it. He wasn’t great to me so really I shouldn’t be so upset but it’s a lot at once I feel. I know this feeling is temporary and it will go away but it just feels very consuming at the moment.

you’ll see what you didn’t get in that relationship.

you’ll remember what you wanted or asked for, and how they never tried to tend to that.

Got broken up with while she was on a month and a half trip to japan. I do not fully know how to feel about this whole endeavor.,"Ive talked with friends about it, at least what I know about her deciding to split up from me. It was going great for a while, texts while she was away were fruitful and fun, and we were excited to do stuff once she got back. But I noticed about 4 days ago the texts got randomly drier, and i started fearing for the worst, and the worst came. It was going wonderful, while we were together it was comfortable, her friends were fun to be around, and her family too. I just don't know how to feel about it, whether I should wait a long time before dating again, or I should just comfortably go back into the dating market. Albeit, I feel pretty confident was this wasn't a super long term relationship, just a nice one and one that I thought was healthy too!

Reason she wanted to split was because she wanted to travel on her own and not want to have another persons feelings to worry about I guess (her not exact full words, but not mine either).  I just don't understand though, if it was great as is, why choose to end it now for the future of her going out and travelling and seeing the world? She isn't exactly rich and also doesn't know fully what she wants to do as a career, and it's going to take a long time till she has the money again to travel, I just ""don't understand"" why she had to end it as it was going healthy! Bottom line though, is I do wish the best for her, and it just sucks to have this happen to me, after all those moments we shared together that felt so genuine and personal I get a call from a text message of, ""morning, can we talk?"" saying that she wants to split up. I don't know it just sucks. I have screenshots of little dms but I can't add them on this subreddit it seems, don't exactly know why but if anyone wants to see them feel free to ask. The screenshots are just dms we had together after I recooperated (I had 2 wonderful anxiety attacks that day from it all happening, I never get those so it was terrifying) basically adding a bit more closure of it all. 

Basically, I'm asking what would YOU the reader do in this scenario, or if any tips that can help me garner a better worldview interpersonally and intrapersonally. Thank you.",1,0,2025-06-28 11:33:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmknhh/got_broken_up_with_while_she_was_on_a_month_and_a/,,,
"She ghosted, lied, manipulated, apologized — and even then, I can’t move on. Why?","6 months ago, I got ghosted by someone I was deeply emotionally attached to. She manipulated me by saying things like, “I have to leave you because of my strict family,” but later I realized that was mostly an excuse. I begged her for proper closure, told her ghosting was childish — but instead of being honest, she flipped it and made it about me not trusting her. Classic gaslighting.

She moved on quickly. Meanwhile, I was stuck in the dark, confused and shattered. To make things worse, she spread false narratives to her friends — portraying me as the villain. That added a deep layer of pain.

Then, 5 months later, she saw a post of mine on LinkedIn and suddenly came back. Apologized tearfully. Begged for forgiveness. Fully admitted to everything — the manipulation, the emotional damage, the lies. She even started people-pleasing and doing “damage control” behavior post-apology. I’ll be honest — it felt like real closure.

But here’s the confusing part…

3 days after the apology, I still couldn’t hold it in — I called her again and bashed her emotionally. She didn’t resist, she just took it. She again accepted all blame. Said she was sorry. And honestly — I believed her.

So now I’ve gotten:
	•	Ghosted ✅
	•	Lied to ✅
	•	Gaslit ✅
	•	Villainized ✅
	•	Apologized to ✅
	•	Given closure ✅
	•	Even got to confront her properly ✅

And still… I can’t move on.

I don’t want her back. I know she’s not emotionally healthy. I don’t trust her at all. But some part of me keeps holding on to the story, the injustice, the emotional loop, or the fantasy of how it “should have gone differently.”

Why do I still feel stuck, even after getting everything I thought I needed?

How would you react?,"She wanted to meet friday (which was the only day we could meet) but told me she has a house party of a friend i havent heard of.

I told her that coming in the morning is fine but idk if ill be awake when she comes back from that party late.. we then settled down to meet on that friday morning go on shopping or whatever.

I wake up and wait for her just for her to send me she is at the mall with her mother... Like... I waited and waited and she just did not come even though she insisted and really wanted to come... So because she really wanted to see me, the only option was to meet friday evening.. but she had that party yes? 

Then she told me she sent him a message to the organizer (her friend) to move the house party to saturday!

I was kinda confused, why on earth someone would move a party to a different day just for her? Anyways she told me it worked, i smelled bullshit.

Then she sent me a screenshot of him saying the party has moved to saturday, but the hour in which he sent the message was edited, you could see the different font there, she edited it (very poorly i must say)

That organizer has sent that message (that the party is moving to be on saturday) way way earlier and she knew she could've met on that friday bc he moved the party to saturday way before she told me she sent him the message. But I already had like plans on meeting with friends because I knew she would go to that party and I didn't want to cancel on them.

I got kinda angry on her for lying, also it was very stupid because this all party stuff was happening only in a week! She misread the date! The party shouldve been on the 10th of the month.. and it was the 3rd of the month (that day she lied) so this whole argument could've been prevented all along if she just read carefully... so it got on my nerves as well that she literally isnt paying attention to the smallest of details like what day is today? When is the party? etc...

My gf(18F) wants to break up with me(18M) for no apparent reason,"We had a planned a meeting yesterday after her school and i asked her when is she finishing her classes, she told me the time and I told her to call me when she finished. I got all ready and called her to see where she is, she suddenly said “we need to talk and I dont want to meet you, I’m going with my friends”. Then I asked her why she didnt tell me that earlier she said she didnt know. Then i hanged out with my friend and after i got home we started texting about what happened and got into a huge argument. Long story short she told me this: “you do not act like a boyfriend, you do not care about my feelings, you do not care about me, you do not care about my health, you dont care about anything, only thing you care about is yourself and how to get out of your problems, you shouldnt be anyones boyfriend, you arent for that” after that we planned 2 hangouts in a row and she was confused on why would i hang out with her after what she said to me, expecting me to be mad, but i do not feel mad I just feel betrayed. She got problems with thyroid gland and has been diagnosed with tumor, i dont know if that could affect how she is acting towards me. I already posted this somewhere else and it got deleted. This was all 3 days ago. Now what ive heard from her friend yesterday crushed me. I came to the club where she was with her friends because my gf told me to come if i want, i told her if she tells me like that i do not feel appreciated and she tells me that she wants me to come but her friends dont. I was my mother on some kids birthday party then i when came to them after about half an hour she told me they go somewhere else and that there is no space for me, they’ve gone to her male friend from the class, the one she found out likes her. In the meantime while i was with them, when my gf has gone outside to take a call ive heard the gross news from her friend Ava. Ava told me that I’m a good guy and that i deserve better because Nadia(my gf) doesnt appreciate me as much and that she wants to break up beacuse she got too much of me and wants me to act like she never told me that so Nadia doesnt get at mad at her. I respect that and i will not tell Nadia about the conversation, but we go to dinner tonight and she wants to talk to me about something. The story isnt well explained because there is too much information to fit in one story. I dont know what to do and most regrettable thing is that she met all of my close family about 2 weeks prior to all of this. Please give me some good advice on what to do next? Have in mind that in Nadias head I dont know what Ava told me.",1,0,2025-06-28 11:14:33,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmkc77/my_gf18f_wants_to_break_up_with_me18m_for_no/,,,
My ex bragged about cheating on me.,"So my ex (26 female) was out on Wednesday night with the girl she cheated on me with, she bumped into some people who we both work with in a night club and started bragging how she cheated on me ( 26 female). 

I was told she was laughing to the point of tears and kept saying how funny it was.

The people who we work with told me today and said how they were very uncomfortable with her saying this and felt like I should know.

I’ve been avoiding my ex in work and don’t speak to her but tonight she was coming out her way to be polite to me.

I think she knows I’ve been told and is wanting me to start a confrontation with her.

 I feel so embarrassed she’s bragging about hurting and cheating on me. She’s not acting like the person who I dated for 4 years and I’m really confused and hurt.

"help. almost 7 years relationship, ended.","hi, F26. this one is just too painful for me. after we broke up. we’re still living with each other. we’ve been living together for almost all the time we’ve been together. felt like we’re married. he then met his ex at an event after the breakup, then met again in another event. unintentionally. then proceed to tell me, he caught feelings again. im torn. that person was his first love. i still love him with all my heart. we did everything together, we travelled, tried all the restaurants and cafes, explored a lot of new things for the first time together throughout the years.

now, i wake up everyday, with the heaviest heart. i get these random sensations throughout my days where i suddenly feel heavy, mind spiraling, feeling hopeless, suicidal, cries multiple times a day and etc. i feel betrayed and left out just like that. we still live together, trying to get through the toughest time together. idk what to do anymore. this is my first time being suicidal. 

we were like soulmates and bestfriends. we really had an amazing relationship. but everything ended just like that. i feel like its impossible for me to love someone else or to be loved by someone else. im tired. i feel defeated. i dont know if i can live with seeing them together. i feel like i need his comfort 24/7 or ill feel like im dying. sounds nonsense but im telling you, i really feel like im dying. please send me some kind advices, im desperate",3,1,2025-06-28 04:54:10,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmehg9/help_almost_7_years_relationship_ended/,,,"I'm so sorry.

anyone else had a sudden spike in sex drive after a breakup?,"Ever since I had a dead sex drive and actually thought I was asexual since I was around 18 years old (im 24 now). My ex thought I didn't find him attractive and I tried my best to not make him feel insecure cause I loved him and it was just I wasn't into that. Our relationship was passionate but toxic, he cheated nearing the end of the relationship. umm, and we had unhealthy habits like smoking and going out to drink a lot. I literally lost my glow in that relationship and I was crying and stressed out 24/7 cause he kept leaving me then coming back. It brought out the worst in me, sex drive still dead till he cheated. something switched in me

Then, when we broke up I was really depressive, sex drive plummeted again. felt ugly, and missed him so much. I was crying and was always anxious. So, I quit smoking and drinking then started taking care of myself more, I felt good. Started to forget about him most of the time, I thought I lost my sex drive again cause I was like that before I even met him and during him. Now tho, I feel like it's in a hyperactive state even when i'm just watching dumb reels online, im not used to it and it feels weird.

im hoping that its because im healthier now, not cause he did what he did to me.

How to heal even after they broke no contact?,"Been trying to heal after ex told me he wasn’t interested in continuing our relationship  randomly (was leading me on for months beforehand during a “break” he insisted on) 

anyways, i was making sufficient progress (not checking socials, not feeling as hurt and resentful) until this dude reaches out 6 months later completely crashing out in my voicemail balling his eyes out, sending me entire essays of how much he regrets his choice, why he did what he did, and having a whole ass mental breakdown and begging me for another chance. (he did reach out a couple times over the course of the 6 months too, legit 2 weeks after he ghosted me which i never responded to,  but still he never said anything to this degree of desperation until now)

i feel like all my progress is gone now  :(  i was trying to heal on the basis of like “why care about someone who didn’t want you” and now, whether intentional or not, whether he was genuinely sorry or not, he reeled me back in. granted, i did tell him to stop contacting me and blocked him for good this time.

but how do i make peace with the fact he’s gone while knowing this information now? most people are so desperate for closure from their ex like that, they just wanna know if they still love them, how they feel, if they miss them, and he told me everything i was wondering without me even having to ask. now i know and i wish i didnt. i wish he never told me and just let me move on in peace.
whether he was being genuine too or not, i knew i couldn’t go back to him and it was best to move on. but even though i know that, it hurts me a lot to know he still cares so much and wanted to try. i feel almost guilty in a way but i know i really don’t owe him anything considering the way he treated me. 

any advice please? :( i haven’t been myself since he reached out.

Doing things alone after breakup.,"I am a 32 y/o female fresh out of a 6 year relationship and I can feel my life passing by. There are so many things I want to do, but, I fear doing them alone. 

I feel like growing up, we were always taught to pity that person alone at the restaurant, movies, etc. 

There is a brewery right down the street from me and I'd love to go there, have a beer and listen to live music.

Is this anxiety I have all in my head? Or will I look weird sitting there alone while all others have friends with them?",39,46,2025-06-27 14:44:18,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1llvoft/doing_things_alone_after_breakup/,,,"Do what makes you enjoy it . You can still enjoy it if you're single. It's not weird to sit alone and enjoy yourself. Everybody does that so don't let anxiety stop you from enjoying yourself. ||| Admittedly the first time or two is strange.  I was your age out of a 13 year marriage and it took some time to do things alone that most people do with someone else.  Start small - I went to a movie alone first, where it seems like people wouldn't 'notice' I wasn't with another person.  Then go to lunch - it just seems more casual than dinner for me.  I eventually got a point where I could go have dinner and cocktail by myself just fine.  I usually sit at the bar of the restaurant but that's mostly so I can watch whatever game is on.  I guess the bottom line is that it will be a little nerve wrecking the first time, but do it scared. ||| Classic. I feel the same way as a 38 year old man. For exactly the same reasons. I think the trick is to not overthink it or even think about it, the more we think the more we don’t do. I don’t know where you are but in London I feel like nobody cares, I’d say go for it. Worst case scenario you come back home! ||| I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Here’s a poem about doing things alone. Someone sent it to me years ago, and it has stuck with me since: I hope it does with you too! I enjoy doing stuff alone personally. Do things just for you, not for how you might appear to others!   How To Be Alone by Tanya Davis  If you are, at first, lonely - be patient. If you’ve not been alone much or if, when you were, you weren’t okay with it then just wait, you’ll find it’s fine to be alone... once you’re embracing it.  We could start with the acceptable places: the bathroom, the coffee shop, the library. Where you can stall and read the paper, where you can get your caffeine fix and sit and stay there, where you can browse the stacks and smell the books  you’re not supposed to talk much anyway, so it’s safe there.  There’s also the gym. If you’re shy you can hang out with yourself in the mirrors, you can put headphones in. And there’s public transportation -because we all gotta go places- and there’s prayer and meditation  no one will think less if you’re hanging out with your breath seeking peace and salvation.  Start simple, things you may have previously avoided based on your avoid-being-alone principles. The lunch counter, where you will be surrounded by chow-downers, employees that only have an hour and their spouses work across town and so they, like you, will be alone. Resist the urge to hang out with your cell phone.  When you are comfortable with eat-lunch-and-run, take yourself out for dinner, a restaurant with linen and silverware. You’re no less intriguing a person when you’re eating solo dessert and cleaning the whipped cream from the dish with your finger; in fact, some people at full tables will wish they were where you were.  Go to the movies where it is dark and soothing alone in your seat amidst a fleeting community.  And, then, take yourself out dancing, to a club where no one knows you stand on the outside of the floor until the lights convince you more and more and the music shows you. Dance like no one’s watching (‘cause they are probably not) and, if they are, assume it is with best and human intentions, the way bodies move genuinely to beats is, after all, gorgeous and affecting. Dance until you’re sweating and beads of perspiration remind you of life’s best things, down your back like a brook of blessings.  Go to the woods alone and the trees and squirrels will watch for you. Go to an unfamiliar city, roam the streets, there are always statues to talk to  and benches made for sitting give strangers a shared existence if only for a minute and these moments can be so uplifting and the conversations that you get in by sitting alone on benches might have never happened had you not been there by yourself.  Society is afraid of alone though, like lonely hearts are wasting away in basements, like people must have problems if, after awhile, nobody is dating them  But alone is a freedom that breathes easy and weightless and lonely is healing if you make it.  You could stand, swathed by groups and mobs or hold hands with your partner look both further and farther in the endless quest for company, but no one’s in your head and by the time you translate your thoughts some essence of them may be lost   or perhaps it is just kept, perhaps in the interest of loving oneself, perhaps all of those sappy slogans from preschool over to high school’s groaning were tokens for holding the lonely at bay. ‘cause if you’re happy in your head then solitude is blessed and alone is okay.  It’s okay if no one believes like you all experiences are unique, no one has the same synapses can’t think like you for this be relieved, keeps it interesting, life’s magic things in reach.  And it doesn’t mean you aren’t connected, that community’s not present. Just take the perspective you get from being one person alone in one head and feel the effects of it  Take silence and respect it. If you have an art that needs a practice, stop neglecting it. If your family doesn’t get you or a religious sect is not meant for you don’t obsess about it.  You could be, in an instant, surrounded, if you need it. If your heart is bleeding make the best of it  there is heat in freezing, be a testament ___   Edit: formatting on Reddit is wonky but you get the gist! ||| I’m 30M and I feel this — I’m fresh out of a 1 yr 3 month relationship, which might not seem very long for some people but def long for me. I’m not someone who dates often so losing that connection is deeply difficult and terrifying when it comes to going out and doing things alone.  For starters I’d say if it’s possible to go do things with friends that you feel comfortable with then do that! That’s something I’m trying to do in the coming weeks, just connect more with not only close friends but friends I don’t see often.  Secondly if the friend route isn’t possible, I struggle with the same feeling you expressed with going out alone. Idk if it’s the same for you but for me it comes from a place of shame and the fear that everyone is looking at me. It’s gotten easier for me to go out to places alone by remembering that no stranger out there is preoccupied with me or why I’m there or what I’m doing. They’re definitely focused on themselves and their own plans. And then when it comes to personal feelings of embarrassment or loneliness or anything like that, I think the only answer is practice with self esteem — telling yourself everyday all the things you have in your life that are good, and then the things you are actively building, and then the all the things you like about yourself. Do it every day and night. It’s about building up a comfort and love with yourself. Because then when you’re out somewhere by yourself it becomes a situation where you are more comfortable doing things that make you feel good and you are more open to the possibilities. You can go out and listen to music or go out to see a movie you want to see if no one else is available because you deserve to enjoy these things no matter the circumstance.  Idk if that’s helpful, I just poured out some thoughts. It’s scary to do things by yourself when you’re not used to it. But stay open to being with friends and meeting new people. And at the same time practice mindfulness and self esteem building and know that you deserve to love yourself and do things you want to do even if it’s just you going to them because you like to do them.

I don't think anyone cared when I asked for a table for 1 and if they did, I was at a point where I didn't really care. I think getting out of these self-dates helped. I say go for it. ||| It’s ok, even if people silently judge you, that’s their problem, not yours. The thoughts of strangers dont effect your life. Don’t be afraid to have fun by yourself. ||| When I started doing things alone it felt “odd”. It takes getting used to.

"Confused, I didn’t see it coming - Blindsided with a familial drama!","
**Background**

My ex and I were just in our 30s. I just got blindsided and found myself in a familial drama!

Long story short, my ex's mum was very controlling. She used to track us while we were dating! Now it was over - they both had a big fight to work it out. And yet her mum just wouldn't let go and kept asking our whereabouts.

**Cause of the Drama**

Her mum's questions had my pressure building up. I decided to give it a shot by venting with my ex. We tried to talk, but it ended up with a fight. She reassured me that these questions had nothing to do with me, and no one had held any grudges. But I felt like my concerns didn't just come out of the blue.

Things began to heat up. I was told to put my thoughts aside, or else I would let her and her family down. My ex became very anxious and said this needed to be done asap. A day later she brought up our past issues & conflicts years ago (those who let her family down in particular, so yep there were grudges). Unaware of most of them, some being too trivial, I was confused - not knowing that she had these hidden emotions.

**Triggering Points**

I suggested lining up a meeting with her family to resolve these past issues & conflicts by being a more supportive partner. To my surprise, my ex insisted that it was up to her mum to decide whether to meet me or not. She warned me not to be childish and rebellious. I thought this could ease our concerns. But then she was in distress. I was told not to act against her mum's will.

My family was very supportive of my ex, hoping that we could walk her through all the family tantrums and help her find solace. But she said it was better for me not to talk about her family dynamics in front of my parents. I was left stranded, and thought this was manipulative. For us this was care, not burden.

**Ticking Bomb**

She had an emotional breakdown. I said we'd better disconnect from each other a bit, giving some space & time to recover. She said she was no longer interested, and that I had become the emotional trigger. She declared to break up immediately, and I didn't see it coming.

It became obvious that she wanted to fix things with her family first. Granted, her mum had been straining our relationship, hence the chat (and the fight). What shocked me the most was that there was lots of blame-shifting at the end of our fight. Wow, what I heard at the end was I was the one who triggered her anxiety for long ...

**Aftermath**

I was blindsided and got ghosted. We went straight into no contact. How on earth would one run away from problems when relationships got hard? I knew dealing with her parents was rough. But I didn’t mean to quit. My partner did, ironically.

**Reflection**

Began reaching out to friends for help and meditation. Talked to social workers and they said these were probably signs of relapse. It’s just sad to see how your partner ended up blaming everything you did for the end of the relationship. I know mentally she’s struggling, and I wish I could stay & help. Yet, I just couldn’t and felt sorry for her.

I’m writing this story to remind all how lovebirds could turn into strangers, because of the family dynamics.

**Moral of the story**

• Did this chat have to turn into a fight? Probably not.

• Could I have said/done something better to salvage the relationship? Yes.

But the blindsiding and all the blame-shifting are so unnecessary. Family and mental health issues could be ticking bombs. It’s just a matter of time.",1,0,2025-06-28 10:30:17,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmjmhc/confused_i_didnt_see_it_coming_blindsided_with_a/,,,
walked away.,"I'm 19f, and my ex (almost) bf was 18. we talked for 4mo. I blocked him after saying goodbye a few days ago because I felt like I was begging for basic love and attention... he almost never never made time for me unless I asked, barely flirted with me anymore, and I always had to start everything. conversations, plans, affection.. I could send him a pic of me and I had to ask him to compliment me. every time I told him how I felt, he’d say I was overthinking or that i overwhelm him. everytime I expressed my feelings he would pick out one thing I said and pretty much victimize himself. he had random days where he was so sweet and I would dread it because the next day, he would be dry again. I mainly left because he completely stopped asking to spend time with me and when I mentioned it he said he just changed and didn't feel obligated to let anyone know. apparently I overwhelmed him just for expressing my needs. we had one final conversation where he acted like he cared so much, but where was all of that when I was trying to save us? not to mention with that talk he told me that I gave up. that I walked away, that he was cheated on in past relationships and forgave it and that he stayed no matter how much I hurt him, that he just wanted me to stay but decided to say goodbye again anyway when I offered him a clear chance to try again if he just gave me his time. so I’m sitting here wondering.. did I give up too soon? was it fair to walk away at this point?.. how can I get over it?",1,4,2025-06-28 10:27:43,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmjl4x/walked_away/,,,"It's hard to say.

You can feel bad for him but I really don't recommend staying with him for too long. It's gonna be a one sided love where you always initiate everything. In my opinion I think you dodged the bullet."
Am I silly for wanting to wait for him or was it the end!?!?!,"Me and this guy hit it off real quick got completely comfortable and everything just felt so right, we were exclusively seeing each other and everything was good up until about a couple months into talking we had miscommunication and we stopped talking completely for about a month and a half until he came back apologizing for how the situation was handled . I ended up forgiving him and we tried again.Everything was good until one of our more recent arguments we kinda lost connection again.

Well a couple days later I drunkenly called him and he met me to talk. I basically told him that I was set on him, and how I just wished we could work things out. He explained to me that encounter wasn't goodbye that is was just a pause, that we just both needed time to work on ourselves so that way we could be better together. We both have a lot goin on in our lives and personally I haven't felt myself, and I know he was struggling when it came to finding work and self issues aswell so that's how that came about. It was leading to a lot of those little arguments and issues.

So hes supposed to be moving due to the fact he couldn't find a job in the area, well he promised that he would come back for me. He basically said that means no contact until he comes back, and that he will come back when things are right and everything is settled. I suggested like what does that mean can we check in? a message here and there? and he said no, no contact.That when he goes through something he genuinely just has to get though it alone, that he don't even plan to keep in contact with his friends and some family ( that threw me off).Long distance also came up and he didn't think long distance would be a good option for us because he knows how I am ( he aint wrong lol) and how it would probably cause more conflict.

well since then its been a couple weeks, he likes my post on social media, and have seen him in my profile views, but still no word. Thing about me is I am more than willing to be with him to be with him though the hard parts but where as he's saying we need to each work on ourselves so that way we can be better together. And genuinely I love this guy so much ( hasn't even been said amongst us) but I feel like Im in left in the position to wait for him, and that just leaves me feeling silly. Idk trying to separate emotions from logic is a battle at the moment :/.In the meantime I have been doing my part, with trying to be the best version of myself. Back to the gym, making money, church, finding new hobbies and trying to keep busy. Several people have even tried to take me out on dates tho but I just can't because it feels so wrong. Genuinely I don't  want to try with anyone else if it's not him. 

Does this sound like he was trying to leave with leaving a door open? Or like is he was trying to protect my feeling in the moment, and didn't want the relationship? Or maybe he just wants to keep his options open and is ensuring im one of them? Im not even sure what I should do atm ( im fighting the urge to contact him), I need outside perspectives!",4,2,2025-06-28 02:44:12,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmc7mh/am_i_silly_for_wanting_to_wait_for_him_or_was_it/,,,"you’re not silly   you’re loyal   but loyalty needs *clarity* or it turns into self-abandonment  no contact + no timeline + no commitment = you’re in limbo while he’s off the grid   that’s not love   that’s being benched  if he really saw a future with you, he'd be building it *with* you   not putting you on pause like a podcast he’ll get back to eventually  you don’t need to chase or check in   you need to keep stacking wins in your world   if he comes back, great   but don’t put your life on hold for a maybe ||| There is no such thing as a ""pause"", I made the mistake of believing in those.

Dumped out of nowhere for being negative,"I F(30) was together with my boyfriend M(29) for almost 3 years and living together for half a year. When I turned 30 some months ago he wrote a card telling me how much he loves me and looks forward to a life together. It was very touching. But it has also been tough the past months as I had a very demanding job where I worked a lot, didn’t sleep well and felt sad and tired during evenings/ weekends, but I would still cook dinner, clean, join some social activities. I was often very sad and cried a lot when I was at home. I talked a lot about my job and got easily uppset over small stuff. I was never mean to my boyfriend, I was mostly mean to myself and complained a lot. He was very supportive, he encouraged me to change jobs, to seek therapy and found jobs for me to apply etc. I applied to a few but was never called for an interview. 

Then one month ago he started to act distant and when I would cry he would look annoyed at me. I would try to talk to him about it but he kept saying that all is good. He said that he loves me and doesn’t want to break up. Then on Saturday morning when we were planning our trip for summer he broke up with me saying ” I am not in love with you anymore, however I still love you”. We talked a lot after and he said that my negativity was affecting him a lot. I asked if I had changed my job a week/a month ago if we would still be together and he said yes. He then moved out from our flat the same day. 

We were then in no contact for a few weeks but I still had hope since it seemed that the breakup was connected to my job. So I started therapy to learn to manage negative emotions better. My workload is better now. So when he wanted to meet up I was very hopeful he would want to try to work on the relationship. Since only a few months ago he was very in love with me. That was not the case. He just wanted to check up on me. He said he feels like this chapter in his life is over and that he rather works on establishing better communication with a new partner that trying to work it out with me. 

Can people really fall out of love in one month? I guess it was longer I just never knew… I am just so heartbroken right now. Do you really need to have all your shit figured out before entering a relationship? How do good relationships work? 
",1,1,2025-06-28 10:03:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmj8dn/dumped_out_of_nowhere_for_being_negative/,,,"Hey stranger :)   M(34) here who went through probably the hardest break up for myself just over a year ago. I wouldn't say he's fallen out of love with you immediately, don't be too hard on yourself. It could have happened gradually over time which yet again, isn't your fault. Everyone has flaws and problems in life, we all struggle at times, so to put blame on your own emotions for a break up is definitely a path you don't want to go down.   I know because I was the same. No arrogance here, I'm pretty active, go to the gym all the time, running, got a good job, but just over a year ago I lost my best friend to suicide. It changed me for a while, I cried a lot for no reason and stopped being as social, then the break up happened 6 months later. I blamed myself and my emotions for getting the better of me, but in reality, the relationship just had hit a wall regardless of that situation and looking back I see it now, it just sped the process up slightly. What I'm trying to say, is that from the sounds of it you were a fantastic partner. You seem selfless and giving all while battling your own struggles. For me, this means regardless of your behaviour, he must have been gradually falling out of love, not something so sudden.   I think one of the hardest parts of breaking up as you get into your 30s is you imagine that partner is the 'one'. The realisation is, there's still so much time. That's what I learnt. I'm only 34, got plenty of time to figure relationships out and hey, probably another heartbreak down the line.   Now how does a good relationship work? Answer? It doesn't always. There are fundamentals to a relationship which can help sustain it, but everyone is different. A good relationship solely works through good and honest communication, attraction and understanding each other.   I won't rant more (gotta get to the gym at some point haha) but I posted here a while back I'm helping people with their own break ups as I'm now a listener for a mental health charity too, so please feel free to reach out in a message :) my name is Andy."
I finally let go. I miss her,"Me and my girlfriend of 1year and 4months just broke up. I had to let her go because I felt I was giving a lot more than she was.

I made her the center of my life. She came above everything sometimes even above family. I would cancel plans with friends, skipped work, my grades sank because I spent most of my time supporting her studies. I am surprised I even graduated college. 

She was by no means a bad girlfriend but it was tiring seeing that my efforts were being reciprocated. I miss her. 

I can’t sleep. This isn’t my first breakup and I’m scared that I haven’t felt the worst. Its night 1

I don’t have anyone to talk to. This is because I decided to spend time with her instead of going out or hanging out with people when they would ask me which is why I resort to Reddit in hopes that someone is listening. 

It was always her first. Always no questions asked. She was the center of my universe.

I Know Closure Isn't Real but What Happened?,"
I know closure isn’t real, but can someone help me understand what happened?

About 2-3 years ago, I (24F) went through the worst breakup of my life. Now, I’m in a loving relationship with a great partner (28M), but I still carry a lot of trauma from that loss. The person I was with was not just a partner; they were a really good friend. I loved them (as I do all my friends) before we ever “fell in love.” 

When they (26NB) broke up with me, they claimed they still wanted to be friends and promised that we could remain in each other’s lives. They had good relationships with their other exes, some of whom I even met, so I believed them. We went no contact a few times, which I initiated to help us have a clean slate. I made it clear that I wanted to be just friends.

However, when my birthday came around, I heard nothing from them. I reached out, only to receive a lengthy message telling me off. I was devastated and confused—at this point, we weren’t even discussing being together again. The message stated that they were in a new relationship and that I needed to move on. I was blindsided. 

Months later, when I tried to reach out again, I found I was blocked on every platform imaginable, even ones I didn’t use. I’ve often wondered what went wrong. Why did I get exiled while they maintained good relationships with their other exes? The loss of our friendship is what hurt the most, and it’s something I don’t think I’ll ever get over. 

I still feel sad about it sometimes, and I can’t shake the feeling of wanting to know what I did wrong. Maybe I’m naive, but I thought it was possible to be friends with an ex; my boyfriend is on good terms with some of his exes, and it doesn’t bother me. I believe it’s healthy to maintain relationships with people you once loved, as long as there are clear boundaries. 

Am I delusional for thinking I could get that friendship back? Do you think I’ll ever receive an explanation one day? What could have happened?

They still had some lingering feelings, not necessarily anything strong, but possibly even little “what ifs”. Potentially they see the best way to deal with it is just completely cut you off.

Finding this closure may never happen, and we fill in with “what ifs” ourselves. Hope you are happier ❤️‍🩹 ||| You didn't do anything wrong.

I tought this weekend was going to be good for me, getting my mind off things. But still I am constantly thinking about him. And by constantly I really mean CONSTANTLY. I see his face when I close my eyes. I can still hear his voice telling me how much he loves me. Everything makes me think of him because we had so much in common. Taste in music, movies, style. So many mutual friends. And it really doesn't help that he's the most handsome man I have ever seen, I know it sounds stupid but it's true.

He made it clear that it's really over, that he just wants to be friends but it's going to take some time to get there. He still cares about me but really doesn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore. But I feel like I'm still in denial. I can't even call him ""my ex"" yet and when people ask about him, I still refer to him as my boyfriend. And when a guy flirts with me, I block it because I feel like I'm betraying him.

How do i deal with a Breakup?,"(Repost bc uh reddit sended it out while i wasnt done yet)


Hiya, in April my Girlfriend broke up with me. I dont know how to deal with it, as im still in love. I still dont know how this happend or what i did wrong as in the text stands she sended was something like ,,its not your fault, its the distance and my loved ones are always so far away‘‘. We agreed on a Break but now the funny thing comes. A week later she called me in the evening saying nonsense like she wants to fuck me and shes so horny, while hearing two of her friends i actually thought was good with laugh in the background. Well, before i could ask whats going in she hang up. I didnt thought anything about it till she sended me a snap showing her bra saying stuff like she made out with her Best friend and how wasted she is. When i watched that, i felt literally heartbroken hoping it was a Prank. One last snap i got then from her how she falled on the ground laughing telling V (the girl she made out with) to stop kissing her. It ended then, i later found out they needed to call 999 as both of them passed out barely making it as they had alcohol poison. I asked my ex girlfriend then if it was a joke or not with the making out. Well, got told it wasnt and she shouldve been clear we are actually done.. i know maybe i am fearing nonsense but i feel like she just dropped me and is now togheter with her best friend as she posted yesterday on Instagram a picture hugging her waist, and changed her profile picture from us to them togheter.

How can someone change so quickly?,"I [19f] only dated my ex [20m] for 3 months, but we were really close friends before that and I think that’s what I’m grieving more than the relationship itself. (Yes I should have left earlier before I get those comments idk why I stayed it was my first relationship) 

He seemed perfect for me on paper and I rlly liked him which is rare for me my type, same goals, same interests, not a frat guy, very sweet  a shy loverboy . He noticed I love California (where he’s from) invited me to roadtrip back at the end of school and even offered to help pay for my flight back so we he would tell my roommate he was nervous around me and actually liked me unlike his ex or other girls and do typical things you do when u crush on someone. We started dating and  he said things like “I could marry you,” “I want my kids to have your eyes,” and “you bring me peace.” He told his mom about me two days in, even though she didn’t know about his ex.

But things started to unravel. He blamed his lack of effort on a girl from years ago who hurt him when he tried, and I regret excusing it. He’s Christian and I’m not, and while he said it didn’t matter, he flipped after I questioned parts of the Bible suddenly saying he couldn’t marry me ever anymore and that was strike one?? I told him to rethink things, and he said, “No, I want you. Christian girls aren’t fun anyway.” And would say don’t breakup with me I’ll be sad and don’t love bomb me?

Over time, he got colder and meaner. He said awful things called me pathetic for falling off a bike, said I was like a dog on a leash, got annoyed at me for crying when we were about to go long distance, and told me he couldn’t hurt a Christian girl when I asked why he doesn’t go date one instead. Got annoyed I wouldn’t give him head he said “it would have sucked anyways”, even though he’d said he wanted to wait until marriage for anything just weeks earlier. But then would switch up the next day saying I mean so much to him, he can’t sleep without me , taking to me brings him so much peace , I’m such an amazing girlfriend and this pattern kept going. 

During a roadtrip to California, the worst came out. He was distant, didn’t want to take me anywhere, and broke up with me out of nowhere I freaked out and said some things like I need you, pls don’t do this it will ruin my summer (I took all this back and apologized) then backtracked and said we could try for another month. He later cried in my arms about being a bad boyfriend, but the next day he got annoyed at me for crying and said if I did it again, he wouldn’t take me to the airport (despite letting me cry in his arms 2 weeks ago saying he cares about me) He went cold again, he saw me crying and just turned over and went to bed again I was crying cus it was our last night together and he was cold and wouldn’t accept my apology for my anxious reassurance seeking earlier.

After I got home, I gave him space, but when I did reach out, he was annoyed. I asked to visit and he said he needed space all summer. When I asked where he stood emotionally, he officially broke up with me, saying “I don’t like you enough,” “I’m too mean to you,” “I can’t marry you,” and “I need to be alone and closer to God” “and he always feels like the bad guy and I can’t function without him” (not true I’m very self sufficient) despite making future plans with me just days before. The last week in California he did say things like closeness scares me , I feel trapped avodiant 101 so I tired to learn about it and give him space and told him working on my anxious attachment and apologized for anything I could have done wrong. But it still ended a week later. 

He also
- could only handle communication long distance over Snapchat streaks and Fortnite 
- indecisive about everything in his life 
- had no friends because everyone was mean apparently 
- was cold and making jokes while breaking up with me and then talked to me the next day and was like “girl your still sad about that?” 

It was short but genuinely such a mindfuck we agreed to stay friends but I basically got cut off from his life and he seems fine now I wasn’t perfect I was anxious but I was doing what I could to change for him and be better I think the worst I would do was cry or be sad and when he asked why I would say him and other things (which was true) , but he also admitted I was perfect for him so who knows. It rlly hurts because he dated me for my kind loving heart , knew I was a hopeless romantic, knew I never dated anyone Becasue of my trust issues and still did this.

For context, my boyfriend of 4 years and I went on a 2 week vacation with my family to Ireland.

After we landed, everything seemed okay. We hugged and kissed and we went to our houses. (We don’t live together. Weird, I know) he didn’t talk to me for two days after that.

I thought maybe he needed to decompress after day one so I gave him the space, but after day two I got worried. I finally texted him today and just sent a simple “hey love how are you? We haven’t talked for a while so I wanted to check in” he then calls me and everything was like our normal conversations we’ve had. Until I asked a dreaded question…I asked him where we stand…he was quiet and then he said let’s talk about this Monday in person. I then asked if we’re going to break up and he said maybe...?

Chapter 2: When Love Burns,"Chapter 2: When Love Burns

After leaving his dream job in the Air Force, Neer believed life would reward him—for choosing love over everything else.
He began preparing again for government exams, and every single day, he’d meet her.
No matter how tired, how busy, how drained—he showed up.

Intimacy was her way of expressing love. And for her, he never said no. Not once. Even when he was tired, broke, or mentally exhausted, he gave her all of him—emotionally, physically, completely.

Then one day, before one of the most important exams of his life, she mentioned something casually—“One of my friends said, you won’t marry me.”

That single sentence broke his focus.
His paper went blank.
His heart was filled with panic, not questions.

He came back to her the next day and cried for the first time in front of her, holding her hand, pleading, ""I will marry you. I’ll never leave you.""
She smiled. Hugged him. And he believed her.

What he didn’t know was that the same ‘friend’ she mentioned would soon take his place in her life.

Neer started changing himself.
He stopped talking to girls, called everyone didi or behen.
He left studies, skipped exams—everything to win her trust.

But the cracks were forming.

Their daily meetings turned into daily fights.
Still, his loyalty never faded.
Until the day he saw her.
With him.

The same guy.

She lied. He believed.
But the next time he saw the same man at her college, meeting her, laughing with her—the volcano erupted.

For the first time in years, the aggressive, blunt, fiery boy inside him returned.

He confronted her. She said, “Don’t fight for me. I am yours only.”

And he believed again.

Until she got in the other guy’s car.
And he followed, crying on his bike, broken, begging silently, hoping it was a misunderstanding.

It wasn’t.
She kept meeting the other guy. Again. And again. And again.

40 times.

Each time, she came back to Neer.
Each time, she still shared that intimacy with him.
And Neer… he allowed it. Because his heart still beat for her, even as his mind shattered.

He lost his grip.

Drugs came next.
Painkillers for a pain no medicine could fix.

She knew.
She didn’t stop him.

But she also never stopped asking for more from him—physically. And he kept giving. Because love blinded him.

"Truly, how long will it take for me to get over this breakup and forget my ex?","I dislike frequenting this subreddit/posting on it because i hate to dwell on the past, however it’s been about 5 months since I ended things with my ex and I feel like i’m still stuck in the past. We dated for roughly about 5 months and i honestly hoped to be over it by this point but i still feel pain remembering the situation. It was a very messy breakup, ended with me being betrayed and disrespected terribly and I uncovered it all on my own. It was my first relationship and we really loved eachother, planned to get married and meet eachothers families etc. I have let go of that fantasy and longing for things that no longer will come into fruition, especially when i remember the disrespect. 

I spent so many months ruminating, checking social media and rotting away but have been redirecting that time and energy back into myself by getting back into fitness and going back to pursue my studies. But i just feel so hurt still, like i’ve been left in the past and I have the most cynical outlook on relationships now after having my trust betrayed like that. My next relationship, whenever that is, will never hold that same innocence again. I’ve tried dating again to explore my options and I genuinely hate it so I’ve stopped now — i’m clearly not ready yet. I don’t know what I want from writing this all out, i just feel really sad and since the breakup I have really struggled with sleeping as I am restlessness at night remembering all the pain i’m still holding inside..

I think of him only at night but I always remind myself that nothing is going to change. I may hold feelings but now life is not just bearable, but enjoyable. I think acceptance and finding things you enjoy is what helps most. Listening to music, going to festivals, and tanning (safely) has helped me so much. It’s different for everyone so do not be too hard on yourself. I didn’t think I’d make it, but I did. It just takes time unfortunately. Talking to people and getting advice didn’t change the pain. It helped, but eventually the effect wore off. Personally, it was just time. To let it happen and keep moving on and finding your way in life. Keep going, you got this ❤️ ||| One thing that I struggle with is wanting so bad to get over my grief and pain, but also knowing that in order to do that I have to be as healthy and patient with myself as possible, and not worrying about how long it will take.  One of my biggest pieces of advice, and I'm sure many people have told you this too, is to just brain dump all your emotions, let all your feelings out. I like to type it out, but writing it out is also great. I always noticed when I had really long emotional conversations with friends, I always felt better, and letting out all your thoughts and emotions in a singular moment is so beneficial(especially since you can't rely on friends all the time for support).   And I get it, in those moments you feel paralyzed, like the only thing you can do is numb your brain with scrolling or some other thing. I've been trying to do it every morning, and some mornings I wake up and I think, fuck writing out my stupid thoughts, but I've learned that on those days the mornings are always the longest.  Because everything becomes harder when you are grieving. Working out, eating healthy, studying, hanging out with friends, loving yourself. But once you have your mind cleared, maybe its just a little easier to get out of bed. And that makes all the difference."
3 About to be 4 Year Relationship and I think I Need to End it. Seeking Advice,"I’ve been with a girl for 3 years now, our anniversary is at the end of July. Things have always been really good. We’ve taken some 5 or so trips together inside and out of the country and she is very much in love with me. 

The problem is me tho, since the beginning of our relationship it’s almost like I feel a half love for her, like it’s just never reaching that “madly in love with you” type of feeling. No matter how much I try, I just can’t seem to get to that feeling. I clearly love this girl but the more and more I think of it, if we got married, I’d always have a wandering eye, thinking that I could get to that full love feeling with someone else. 

Every time I think about breaking up with her, I’ve been too scared to hurt her. To make it worse, our families are pretty close (our moms are damn near best friends). All of this puts a lot of pressure on me and I just don’t know what to do.

What are some specific thoughts or perspectives I should reinforce in my mind when I'm spiraling?","The worst of it comes not when I'm crying but in those mornings or nights where I think about the memories and spending time with her, the way she laughed or the way she looked at me back when she was so in love. I think about her body, the smell of her hair, and the funny jokes and faces she made. 

During these times I feel an awful kind of pain, a sort of limbo-like grief, somewhere between feeling normal and crying.

"Her Blue, My Sky"" – A Love Story","In a small town tucked within the deserts of Rajasthan, there lived a boy named Neer—a dreamer, a lover, a little reckless, and endlessly real. It was in Class 11 that his world quietly changed.

He saw her.

Reen—dusky, beautiful, and impossibly perfect. She wasn’t just another girl in the class. She was the moment he started believing in something deeper. She wore blue one day, and he swore the sky borrowed its colour from her.

At first, he just stole glances. But fate wasn’t interested in silence. After two months of shared space and passing smiles, they started talking—about everything and nothing. Neer fell in love with the way her voice danced, the way her laugh filled the air like it belonged there. Reen was playful, mischievous, making games out of numbers, gifts out of guesses. She was the kind of girl you didn’t just love—you felt her.

And then… she proposed.

His heart pounded so loud he thought the whole world could hear it. But the answer was already in his eyes: “I love you too.”

They began dating—two hearts beating faster with each day. In Class 12, even though they were in different sections, Neer made sure he was near her every period. Passion took its place beside affection. They explored love emotionally and physically, unafraid of judgment, unbothered by gossip. In their small town, everyone knew their story, because Neer didn’t hide it. He wasn’t afraid to kiss her on the road, or whisper “I love you” in front of the world.

She was his, and he was proud.

But school life ended, and so did the comfort of routine. Dreams pulled them in different directions. She got selected for veterinary sciences, while he started preparing for NEET. But love isn't logical—it’s emotional. After 2–3 months of coaching, the ache of distance grew unbearable. He dropped NEET and came back home, unable to fight the emptiness her absence caused.

They were together again. But the road ahead wasn’t smooth. She moved forward in her journey. He started preparing for government exams, and in time, got selected for the Indian Air Force.

It was a dream come true.

But love doesn’t follow resumes or ranks.

One night, she looked at him and said, “Don’t go. I can’t live without you.”

So, he didn’t.

With the confidence of a boy who had already given his everything for love, Neer left the Air Force, believing he could build a life near her—because what’s the point of flying high if the one you love is not waiting when you land?",1,0,2025-06-28 08:29:38,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmhubw/her_blue_my_sky_a_love_story/,,,
"She Left Me When I Was at My Lowest. It Still Hurts, But I’m Rebuilding","
We didn’t meet in a bar or a park or through friends at a party. We met through a message. A message I didn’t expect, from someone I didn’t know. Her roommate had mentioned me—said I was part of the international student community, that I spoke French. So she reached out. I didn’t understand at first what she wanted. She was cautious, maybe shy. It took time for her to explain. For a second, I even wondered if the account was fake. But something told me to keep the conversation going. And I said yes.  

Yes to helping her practice French. Yes to something small that would become much more.  

The first time I saw her was in early October. The air was cool. She wore a look of quiet curiosity, with soft eyes that seemed to carry more than she ever said. I remember walking away from that first meeting thinking, *She’s different.* Not dramatic. Not loud. Just… different.  

And we kept talking. She’d ask me how to say things in French. I’d correct her with a smile. We started walking together. Then texting more. And then it grew into something more than I realized, until it became everything.  

I still remember the moment I knew I was falling for her. It was our first kiss. Early December. I had bought flowers, met her at the train station, and there was this quiet warmth between us. I wasn’t nervous anymore. I felt something settle inside me. Like I had found a place to land.  

She told me she loved bento cakes, so I planned to surprise her with one for her birthday. She once said that her last birthday was lonely—she even showed me a photo of her with a very small cake, alone, that no one did anything special for her. I promised myself I would change that. That this year, she’d feel celebrated. That she’d remember it as the birthday someone finally made her feel seen.  

We shared so many small things that became big memories. We cooked together—spicy noodles, warm soup, her favorite breakfast. We even made a list of dishes we wanted to try. That list stayed unfinished, like most things between us. We watched series together. I still haven’t finished the shows, and I probably never will. Those were *our* moments, *our* shows. And the movie she told me to watch? It’s still sitting in my folder, untouched. It hurts too much to watch it now. I was saving it so we could talk about it after. Now, there’s no after.  

She had a cat—a quiet, fluffy presence in her life. She sent me photos constantly. Him on the windowsill. Hiding under a blanket. I grew fond of that cat, not just because of him, but because of what he meant to her. He was a part of the home she carried with her.  

We even talked about going places together—exploring, traveling, trying things we hadn’t done before. Simple things. Beautiful things. There was a quiet poetry in those ideas, like we were sketching out the early drafts of a shared future. We once even talked about the places we wanted to live in. She had a very precise place in mind, in a big city to the north. She showed me the exact streets she dreamed of living in. We put a map marker there, and I promised her I would buy a home for us there someday. I finally had a goal, something to work toward. I never felt more motivated, more happy to work toward something.  

But then, slowly, I started to feel her slipping away. Her answers became shorter. She always looked a bit bored. Her texts felt like she was forcing herself to write to me. She got mad over small things that didn’t matter before. I wasn’t perfect, of course—I have my flaws—but I did my best and worked to fix them. She was always the priority.  

At first, I thought it was just stress. Exams. Fatigue. Life. I didn’t want to believe she was changing her mind. I tried to be patient. I didn’t want to pressure her. I believed that love meant giving space. She deflected my questions each time. I tried multiple times to open her shell, but she didn’t want to talk. Like she didn’t want the problems to be solved.  

She told me I wasn’t expressive enough. That I was too closed. So I tried. I opened up. I told her about my struggles. About what it’s like to be a foreigner, alone, building a life from scratch. I made myself vulnerable. I told her what I thought when she did things I didn’t like. I started to feel comfortable. She was the kind to be open about her wants and needs, so I thought maybe she expected the same from me. But now that I think about it, she never talked about what she *really* thought.  

And then came the message.  

She told me it was over. That she had *“lost her feelings.”* That it wasn’t my fault. That she was open to talk, but to please not try to convince her to change her mind. That I was an amazing boyfriend, that me opening up to her wasn’t the problem—I didn’t even mention that, which makes me think maybe it *was* about that. She also added something about giving me back the money for an expensive gift for her birthday, one she found by mistake. Like our relationship was a transaction. Like money was important for me in that moment.  

And the worst part? It happened a week before her birthday. A week before the cake. The plan. The small hope I carried that maybe this year, I could give her something beautiful.  

Even though i might not have made the best chocies before, i knew that i shouldn't beg for the relationship back or ask her to rethink her decision, i knew a relationship where only one person wants to be in is not something i wanted.

About the night she wrote the message:  

She was coming back to town on a train that night. I was supposed to meet her at 4 a.m. to walk her home—I always did, because I was afraid something would happen to her. But this time, she didn’t want me there.  

Instead, I packed a bag with everything she’d ever given me: the books, the half-empty bottle of perfume, the notes she’d scribbled during lectures. The birthday gift. I waited outside the train station in the dark, my hands shaking. It was snowing. When she arrived, I handed it to her without a word. I didn’t want these ghosts in my room anymore. She looked at me. The only words I could say were, *""Why… exactly like your ex did to you?""* She answered that it was different. I didn’t have the strength to argue, so I left.  

She looked tired. Not sad. Just tired.  

*“We can talk tomorrow if you have questions,”* she texted later. Like she was scheduling a dentist appointment.  

The next day, I cried in front of her. I’m not proud of it. But I won’t pretend it didn’t happen. I couldn’t hide the pain. She looked at me and said, *“I’m sad too.”* But her face was calm. She didn’t cry. She didn’t flinch. I asked why. She gave me the same answer. She said she was sorry, but we could stay friends. I said not for now. But through it all, she was so calm. Like she was a robot. Like it was something annoying she just had to do. The closeness, all the moments—it didn’t mean anything.  

And that’s when it really broke me.  

She had never told her friends I was her boyfriend. Said we’d wait. I agreed, even though it made me feel invisible. She still had a photo of her ex and her on her page—the one that dumped her by saying *“I lost feelings”* and left without a word. I told her it bothered me. She promised to delete it later, but she didn’t want to for now. She never did. She said it didn’t mean anything. But it meant something to me.  

On New Year’s Eve, she went to a party. Two of her exes were there. None of her friends knew about me. One guy asked her out. And she didn’t say, *“I have a boyfriend.”* She just told me after—casually, like it didn’t matter.  

It *should’ve* mattered. But I didn’t say anything. I stayed quiet. I thought love meant understanding.  

But love also means respect. And I should’ve stood up for myself.  

By the time I did, it was too late. She had already decided to leave.  

One more important thing:  

**The Camera and the Photos We Never Saw**  

Once, I bought her one of those old-fashioned cameras—the kind where you take 30-something photos and have to develop them to see what you’ve captured. She loved the idea of it. The waiting. The surprise.  

We took pictures together. Silly ones. Tired ones. A few where she’s looking at me in a way that, at the time, made me think she saw a future too.  

But we never developed them. She took the camera with her when she left.  

I wonder now what those photos would’ve shown. Were there moments she loved but forgot? Did she ever look at them after? Or were they just another unfinished thing—like the movie, like the birthday cake, like us?  

**The Mistake: a few Months Later**  

I lasted one month without reaching out. Then I reached out about my promise to teach her French. I don’t know what I wanted—maybe to see her. I didn’t expect anything. I’m not a big believer in friendship after love, so I probably expected closure. I said we should meet in March or April. She said April because the weather would be better—even though inside, I knew we started hanging out in October when the weather was worse, so this was probably a pretext. But I was happy with it.  

In the last week of April, I wrote to her. I told her I was disappointed in her. (I knew this was her last year and she would leave in may, so she planned on leaving without ever honoring her words anyways or texting about that ) but I probably shouldn’t have. She said she never promised—it’s true, she just said the idea fit her, but still, she knew what it meant. Probably. I was upset, so I didn’t write for a while. But after some time, I wrote to make peace. I felt like I didn’t need to have those bad feelings in me anymore, we even joked a little, even if it felt weird.

One month or a few weeks later, an idea started floating in my head: *Was it really “lost feelings,” or was she just trying to soften the blow?* I thought she wouldn’t mind telling me after so long. But I misread the situation.  

I asked.  

Her reply was like a knife.  

She got very upset she said writing her was wrong that it wasn't normal, she probably felt cornered like i was accusing her, that wasn't my goal, i just wanted closure in some way, it didn't help that my message was very long i can understand her being annoyed, i always write like that when i have something deep to say. but it was probably a chore for her, she even said that, the tone and aggressiveness didn't affect me but what did was the last phrase.

*“I let you go,”* she said. *“So please let me go.”*  

I was gonna answer "" off course! You left me without giving me any chance but then i realized.""

She was probably right, it's been long she didn't have any obligation towards me, and i had been too focused on all of this probably, so i just apologized and and told her goodbye for good,


I realized then: closure wasn’t something she could give me. It was something I’d have to claw out of myself.  

I work every day to become the man I swore I’d be. For myself. For the future. For the life I want to build. But no matter how hard I work, there are moments where the sadness comes back.  

Sometimes I remember. Sometimes I feel stuck. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever be able to trust someone again. Not because of who she is, but because of what I became after.  

Still, I keep going.  

Because I know that next time, I’ll be smarter. I won’t give my heart too quickly. I won’t ignore the signs. I’ll speak up when something hurts. I won’t allow myself to be a secret.  

And I have my new goal. I *will* buy that house in that part of town she talked about—not for her, but for me. I will realize all the dreams we had together, but for *me.* I have a new goal, and she just chose not to be part of the equation.  

If she ever reads this—and I doubt she will—I don’t write it for pity. I write it to remember. To mark the moment I changed. To remind myself of who I was, and who I’m becoming.  

If someone out there is reading this and going through something similar—I promise you, the pain fades. Slowly. But it fades. And in its place, something stronger grows.  

I don’t know if she’ll ever look back. If she’ll ever realize what she walked away from. Maybe she’s already found someone else. Someone with more money. More time. More status.  

But I know this: I gave her everything I had. Even when I had almost nothing.  

And now I’m building something better—not to win her back, but to prove to myself that I didn’t break. That I’m still standing.  

This chapter ends here.  

The next one is already being written.

Just broke up with her a week ago.....,"‎I honestly don’t even know where to start. I lose the love of my life a week ago. She was the first woman I truly loved more than anything in this world and also the first girl I ever dated seriously.
‎Throughout our relationship, we went through a lot. There were three breakups, and one major fallout that nearly tore us apart. But somehow, we always found our way back to each other. No matter what happened, we both returned like we couldn’t stay away for long.
‎But now... it’s different. She's really gone. Blocked me. Disappeared like I never existed. And I don’t know how to process this pain. It's my first time going through something like this, and the weight of the regret is unbearable.
‎She loved me. She trusted me. She cared for me in ways no one ever had. And now, it’s like I’m a stranger to her just a memory she erased.
‎Everything feels so cold now. My phone doesn’t ring. No notifications. I’ve cut everyone off, deleted all my social media, hoping I could use this silence to find myself again... to maybe come back stronger. But the truth is, I feel lost.
‎The nights are the worst. Trying to fall asleep feels like torture. Every time I close my eyes, all I see is her face—those beautiful eyes that once looked at me with so much love. Her voice echoes in my head like a loop I can’t escape.
‎I cry sometimes. And honestly, crying is the only thing that helps a little, like it's the only proof that I can still feel something. But even then, I’m not sure if I’m healing or just sinking deeper.
‎She was everything I ever wanted. My heart, my peace, my reason. Now that she’s gone, I feel like I’ve lost the purpose of my life.
‎If anyone’s been through this, or has something—anything—that could help, please… I could really use it right now.

Feel like a sad zombie and need help,"So I got broken up with a month ago and I just can't. Literally every single thought is him, or something he said or something we did and it's driving me insane. EVERY GODDAMN THOUGHT.  Everything is just tainted with his memory.

Basically for the last 30 or so days all I am doing is waking up and just watching shows and I don't even wanna watch anything, I  just do it so that I can't think about him. I don't feel anything when watching the shows it's just to keep my brain quite for a while. I am actually going insane. And I just want it to stop, I don't feel human anymore. I just wake up and try to occupy my brain with as much garbage as I can, to not think about him. 

Why does this hurt so much? I have been through worse, I have been through so much worse than someone just changing their role in my life. I am currently no contact, but if I let him ik he will be in my life (as a friend) forever. I have been through worse, I just don't know why I am basically paralyzed. I got dropped out of two internships cause I just wasn't able to do anywork. And they were really important, and I just fucked it up. I troubled, am still troubling my mom a lot. I just can't.

What's worse is any friend that I break this news to just blows it over, that he will come back. And I mean I don't blame them, I broke up with him once cause I thought he deserved better, and that I couldn't be better...And he broke up with me cause he wanted to and cause he doesn't love me. Huge difference .So I mean he's not ever coming back, and I know it very well. Just why is there a dumb f*cking sliver of hope that he will? I know for a fact he won't yet some tiny part of me thinks he will and I just hate for that hope to be there cause it's just tiring. I don't wanna hope for something that isn't going to happen. It's so foolish, it's like waiting for pigs to fly just so dumb. I can't with myself

And what sucks the most is I knew from the very beginning that this was going to happen. I knew it. I know I am not necessarily a joy to date so I kept putting him off, I told me every single day why we shouldn't date. Heck he even experienced how it's gonna be like dating me before we actually dated. I only agreed to date him cause he said "" not dating you hurts more than dating you"". And uk what i still would have gotten it if he broke up after that, I still would have. The only reason I am so frustrated is he broke up when I was trying the hardest to be better (I was trying earlier too but not hard enough just more passively). I had decided, set out a plan with checks and points to be a better person, to be someone who deserves to date him. I didn't want someone else to be that ""better"". And it wasn't just all talk. I spent 3 f*cking hours trying to make a hello kitty half presentable. I am not artistic at all, I couldn't draw a straight line even if the world depended on it. I had other people who were more than willing to help me. But I wanted to show him that I love him, be it 3 grueling hours of pure frustration to make an okayish card... And he just broke up. When I was putting in more effort he just ended it. And it hurts, I could be the perfect person but I can't force him to love me,now can I? 

Please don't give me the ""other fishes in the sea"" reasoning. Ik there are. I don't particularly believe in soulmates. My philosophy is that you can pick anyone you want and love them and make a soulmate Outta them. But I picked him, I picked him to be my forever and I was really trying, pulling in all the stops and he just didn't ...pick me. I guess arranged marriages are right afterall? That way it becomes more difficult for the other person to unpick you. I have kinda lost faith in love. What even is the point? You love too much, you lose. You love too little, there's no one left to love anymore.

I need a distraction, my screen time is freaking 12 hours. I try to sleep for the other 10 and 2 is just miscellaneous ig. Sleeping is another escape but even it sucks. Him and his friends come in my dreams without fail, every goddamn day. I just can't deal with it. Every single dream. And the going-to-sleep part is even worse, cause it's just me left alone with my thoughts, thoughts of him. Pure torture. And I don't have a ton of friends, everyone is at home for the vacation. I don't have much to do around my hometown either. Not a very happening city unless you have a lot of money at your disposal.

I can't go to professionals for help either, dating isn't something that's very accepted among the elders yet where I am from.

I am just really really tired of being a mindless zombie. I wake up, try to forget the new dream about him where everything is normal and rainbows and sunshine, and force myself to watch a something that doesn't have anything loving in it, bathe while crying, eat while watching something, continue watching, eat again, and then sleep. That's all I have been able to do.

Eating is another thing I can't particularly do well either, I was already underweight to begin with but I had some fat. It's just all gone and my clothes don't fit me anymore and I know it's very unhealthy but no matter how hard I try I just can't get myself to eat more than a couple of bites without feeling nauseous. Another physical ache has been chest pains. It started after the breakup, whenever a thought about him stings my chest starts aching and it takes 2-3 hours to slowly die. And then another thought and it's back again within a couple of minutes.

I can't get myself to enjoy any hobbies or work. It's just leaves room for me to have thoughts. I don't draw or paint. I can't listen to music cause most of them are about love or heartbreak or have things that remind me of him. Playing games that I like or reading books still just leaves so must space. I can't survive the space.

I just don't wanna live anymore. Please don't go up looking suicide hotlines. I am not going to pull a Juliet over a guy. All I mean is that if a bus was headed my way my first instinct won't be to move out of the way, it would require more effort.

I don't want a rebound either. What's the point? One of us would get hurt anyways and I think I am just done with love.

One particularly saddening concern is that I don't enjoy rain anymore. I have always had a sort of innate childish excitement towards rain. You know how there's like an internal excitement when you go on a roller coaster. I used to automatically get that whenever it rained, without fail even if I was in a depressive episode. It just had to rain and I would get out of my funk. It was just very internal. But it just is sad how I am very indifferent towards it now. I don't want to be indifferent, I want my old excitement back but now it rains and I can't care less.

I am hoping it gets better when I head back to college but I doubt it will. I can't fathom running into him or his friends, I know I will just break down at the sight.

Sometimes, just sometimes, for brief moments I think it's going to be okay and I become normal but it just lasts for like 10 minutes and it's back to zombieland again.

I would have married him with a paper ring, stuck out through thick and thin but I guess it's just it huh. 

Thanks for reading my sad little rant. Even if you don't have any advice to offer, I am still very grateful that you took your time out to read. Hope your day is way better than mine.

Three Years of Silence,"
It’s been three years.
Three years… and I haven’t heard her voice. Not even once.
No message. No call. No sign that I still exist in her world.

And yet—she still lives in mine.

I know she’s with someone else now.
Maybe he gives her the things I couldn’t… the stability, the readiness, the future she deserved.
And I hope—truly hope—she’s happy.
But deep inside, there’s a quiet ache that never stops whispering:
“She was the one.”

Because I didn’t love her like the others.
She wasn’t just another chapter.
She was the whole book.

And people say,
“You’ll fall in love again.”
But what they don’t understand is:
I never “fell” in love with her—
I became love when I was with her.

Since she left, I’ve refused to be with anyone else.
Not because I’m trying to be loyal to a ghost.
But because I know how it feels to be loved for real—
and I won’t fake it with anyone just to fill the silence.

I’ve made that mistake before…
Got close to someone just to numb the emptiness she left behind.
But all I did was hurt someone who didn’t deserve that pain.
And I won’t do it again.
Not because I’m strong—
but because I fear God…
and I fear breaking a heart the way mine was broken.

So now, I’m fighting this battle alone.
Quietly.
Without posting about it.
Without asking for pity.
Just me… and the memory of her…
against the weight of time.

Some nights I think:
“Maybe love isn’t for me.”
Maybe marriage… family… happiness—
they all belong in a life that just isn’t mine.
Because how do you recreate something so real…
so deep…
so once-in-a-lifetime?

You don’t.
And maybe I’m not supposed to.

I’m not looking for a new story.
I’m still living in the one I never got to finish.
Because the feelings I had with her—
they weren’t ordinary.
They were indescribable.
They were sacred.
And some things… you just don’t replace.

advice?,"i feel as though i need advice on whether or not im right or wrong in what i said. 

(BACKSTORY: my ex and i were really happy, but behind the scenes we couldn’t go 3 days without an argument that escalated to the point where i was being given death threats by the person who was meant to love me the most. yet it was always me who was saying sorry.)


we broke up 3 weeks ago because he said he needed a 2-3 month break from women due to his grandma being in hospital with terminal cancer. he said the whole we can still be friends and talk and everything. i knew his grandma did have cancer, but not that it was terminal.

when we were together, he was so protective of me. i felt as though i had to me evil to men- i couldn’t talk or interact with them without him getting mad at me. so obviously, feeling free, i felt as though i could do anything now. i rang someone he used to be friends with, telling him what happened. i then told my ex and he proceeded to block me. i was like… okay?

so fast forward like a week, i found out he went around telling everybody our private business. that really pissed me off, so i went off on one and said something about him. it was true, im friends with his ex and she backed me up. i didn’t care that everybody knew, he did the same to me. he found out that i’d told people and then went around spreading an insane rumour that is completely false and ridiculous to the point nobody believes him. 

the only reason i knew about this rumour was through one of his friends, who at night i proceeded to call and tell him the full story and he was like your in the right. he then messaged my ex saying stop saying stuff and told him that i was trying to apologize. i couldn’t message him myself cause he’d blocked me. my ex took this apology and brushed it off, telling me to fuck off and i don’t deserve an apology.

fast forward another week, i was already struggling. i then had a friend of mine come up to me and tell me my ex said my house reeks of cigarettes and that it’s disgusting- as if he wasn’t here like everyday. i was so annoyed, but i realised that i was just gonna be the bigger person and ask people who had been to my house if it did indeed smell and all of them said no. so i was like “right okay just ignore him”. 

oh i forgot to mention at this point he’d already gotten on about 2 girls and was flirting with all my friends (they didn’t reciprocate and instead told me). you know so that whole “i need a break from girls” this was bullshit. 

so, 2 days ago i had messaged his friend asking why he broke up with me, because i had been told lots of stories. i got told the full story- he told me my ex broke up with me because he felt as though i was holding him back and just needed an excuse. so i told his friend everything that happened about all these rumours and the only additional thing i had said was that he was a liar because…. well he did?

yesterday i received a message from my ex saying “why have you been spreading stuff about me”. i told him what id said (he already knew) and why i said it. he denied everything about telling other people, but i had that many people i couldnt believe him. so i sent a huge paragraph telling him how i feel and how I’m not over him blahblahblah and he said he wasn’t gonna read that. he threatened me with the “i can ruin you” i said ive told people to stop saying stuff but you’ve gone around saying more stuff about me then i have about you. he was like whatever and ok and just blocked me again.

TL,DR: lying ex, spiralling rumours, blanked apologies and threats 🥹.",1,0,2025-06-28 07:54:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmhc27/advice/,,,
Dont judge i still like her,"
Hi, I wanted to ask something.
I once met a woman — she was beautiful, both in appearance and character. When I met her, I already had a girlfriend, but I just wanted to use her as a distraction because I saw the end of my relationship coming.

Eventually, my relationship ended, and three months later, I got together with that woman. I was an asshole — I forbade things that I did myself and played with her emotions. Nevertheless, she always treated me with respect.

Two months into the relationship, she secretly took my phone and went through everything. She found pictures from my vacation with my ex and chats with several other women. She confronted me, cried, and even met with my ex a few times. But after one week, she forgave me — although the trust was completely gone.

In December, she finally broke up with me for good because I was still the same person.
After that, there was no contact until the end of May. I reached out again, we met, and decided to give it another try. We had a lot of fun — she was very affectionate, wanted to see me often, and things were going well.
We had some arguments here and there, but after one big fight, she messaged me saying she couldn’t do it anymore and didn’t see a future with us.

I told her: “Alright, then block me and that’s it.”
She didn’t do it.

Now it’s been silence since Monday, and I know she’ll contact me again —

I broke up with my gf of 1.5 years 3 weeks ago. She had diagnosed depression and had some avoidant habits which made me anxious a lot of the time, unsure of where we stood, especially because they would ask for breaks every 6/7 months as she would start having doubts about the relationship. 

Toward the end of the relationship there was no affection or effort from her and everyday i was walking on eggshells to avoid a break up text. But now, looking back through old messages and replaying old conversations it doesn’t jump as much, and i’m starting to doubt my decision.

How do I stop feeling unworthy when I compare myself to their new gf?,"Hey everyone, so I had a messy situation with this dude a year ago. We started talking when I was F22 and he was M29. Theres more to the story here but things are too complicated and messy but I’ll just explain what happened in the second part. 

We were friends with benefits I guess but basically he cut me off in the beginning after the first time I went to his house because he felt like I was getting attached. After he left, he came back  because we bumped into each other after months of no contact. He knew that I already had feelings for him prior to that because I told him and made it known thru my actions. 

Anyway, this guy gave me mixed signals, he brought up marriage a few times to me and we had serious conversations about it saying that if things went well between us, he would want to propose to me, on top of that he continued to flirt with me and made sexual implications etc. We went out and had dinner, he sent me home and he gave me a long hug like he didnt want to let me go, I assumed we were heading in that direction.

I texted him the day after to tell him I missed him because I was traveling and he replied me with “thanks for letting me know.” I was furious because its obvious as hell that he was leading me on by giving me mixed signals when he had no intention of dating or marrying me. I confronted him, and he played the victim card and he said he thought I knew this was a friendship? There was no accountability whatsoever from his end. I would have respected it more if he was clear on what he wanted from the beginning because friends dont do that.

Anyway, 2 months after that he started dating someone new. She seems like a sweet girl but man.. I cant help compare myself to her. She’s older than I am and she seems like she has her shit together. In terms of looks, from an objective standpoint, I guess im prettier but she seems like she has an amazing personality I cant help but wonder if maybe I didnt call him out on his BS maybe we would have a chance or maybe if i was more like his new girlfriend, maybe he would date me. It just sucks that they always settle down with the girl they date after me. Why wasn’t I enough to settle down with? Why am I only lusted over and not loved?

My Favorite Stranger,"I wasn’t always like this.

There was a time before her—a time when I knew what I loved, when I had passions that kept me up at night and dreams that pulled me out of bed in the morning. I had favorite things, favorite songs, favorite places, favorite smells. I had me.

Now… I’m just trying to remember.

Trying to remember who I was before she painted herself across every inch of my world. Trying to get back to that version of me, the one untouched by her magic. And it’s not easy—not when the thing I’m healing from is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever had.

You see, we usually heal from pain, from betrayal, from things that broke us. But how do you heal from something that made you feel so alive?

How do you heal from heaven?

Because that’s what she was. When she was next to me, the world stopped spinning. Everything faded. I didn’t need anyone else, didn’t want anyone else. She had this way of making me feel like I was floating… like my soul was flying through sunlight, unchained. My heart would dance, my soul would laugh. I wasn’t just in love—I was love. With her, I was free and safe all at once.

But now she’s gone.

And I’m stuck trying to pull myself out of something that never hurt me in the first place. Isn’t that strange? To suffer from something so beautiful? To bleed from a memory that once made your heart bloom?

She touched me in ways no one else ever will—not just my skin, not just my body, but my spirit. With a glance, she could calm every storm I was hiding. With a laugh, she could make time feel like a soft breeze on a spring day.

And now, all I have are echoes.
Echoes of her eyes.
Echoes of her soul.
Echoes of a feeling that still makes my chest tighten when I try to breathe.

But I have to do it. I have to let go.
I have to make her my favorite stranger.

It breaks something inside me just writing those words. But what else can I do? I can’t live in the past. I can’t keep feeding myself on memories while starving my future.

So, I’m learning to love myself again—not because it’s easy, but because it’s the only way to survive. I’m trying to forgive myself for losing who I was. I’m trying to smile again for no reason. To laugh without her voice in my head. To sleep without her warmth in my chest.

And every day, I dig deeper—through the memories, the pain, the beauty, the loss. I’m searching for that boy I used to be. The one who had dreams. The one who had light in his eyes without needing someone else to ignite it.

This journey is hard.
It’s brutal.
But it’s mine.

And maybe, just maybe… when I find him again—
That boy who once knew exactly who he was—
He’ll smile and say, “Welcome back. I missed you.”

And that’s when I’ll know I’m finally healing.

Even if I still remember her as the girl who once made me taste heaven.",6,1,2025-06-27 21:35:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm5t4o/my_favorite_stranger/,,,"she didn’t *ruin* you   you just got lost in the high  this isn’t about healing from love   it’s about detoxing from dependency masked as magic  she didn’t give you freedom   you *gave* it away  but now you’re clawing it back   line by line   day by brutal day  and yeah, it hurts   because you’re not grieving her   you’re grieving the version of *you* that only existed with her reflection in your eyes  keep digging   he’s still in there"
I need help,"I don't even know where to start and haven't ever posted on this sub but here we go. I (18 m) started dating this amazing girl about a year ago. She was silly, loving, understanding and everything I ever wanted out of a relationship. I purposely haven't dated my whole life to find the right person to avoid heartbreak and I thought I found her. But her parents found out we were together and because of my age at the time (17) they FREAKED out and we had to break up. This broke me, I've been struggling with self harm since and I finally think I'm getting a lot better now. I started therapy and my doctor increased my antidepressant dosage. But I still have a lot of nights where I miss her and consider if I'm really getting better. She was everything to me, and now she's gone with a new boyfriend. I will never be with her and that thought hurts a lot. We are still close friends and both work at the same place. We still joke and have fun in person but it's not what I want. Obviously I love having her as a friend but I'm jealous, I want her back, and I know I can't think like that. I need to move on and a lot of times I actually think I am. But then I'll have a bad night (tonight) which makes me reconsider everything. Any advice or comments would be very appreciated.

Post breakup drama. What do I do?,"BACKSTORY

So I brokeup with my bf about 3 months back. He didn't cheat, things just didn't workout between us. He is a surgery resident and I'm studying for a huge exam. Even when we were together he was ALWAYS busy. I have worked with him so I know it gets really busy So I understood him and didn't disturb him. But he just felt too distant. He never saw my messages, never talked to me properly. And he would never pay attention to me when we go on dates. Like he wouldn't even Look at me!

I talked to him about it. Voiced out how it felt like he wasn't interested. All I asked for him is to message me atleast once a week so I can know what's going on in his life and update him about mine. I was going through a lot emotionally at that time. But then he would gaslight me about being too sensitive and that I didn't have a job yet (was studying 10+ hours a day) so I wouldn't know how hard residency is.

See, I was pretty sure I wasn't toxic but then I wanted to know if I did something wrong so I would ask him if I am the one not understanding him. I would ask him why he wouldn't even smile when he is with me. Or why he couldn't text/ talk with me properly. And he would give me vague answers saying no or would just say that I was torturing him in a not-serious tone.

We were together for 1.5yrs and we were happy only for the first 3 months. Our relationship was fun, we would go out eat, have fun. He talked to me and showed me all those cute gesture where he would randomly kiss my hand or stroke my hand. I was literally so in love with him. But then it all went down, he started ignoring me. I was bawling my eyes out every single month. I talked to my friends about it any they said it's a normal phase in a relationship and I held on.

Around the start of March he called me drunk and asked me if we should break up. His fam didn't approve of me because I belonged to a different religion and was torturing him mentally for a long time so he couldn't take it anymore. I knew about his fam looking for an alliance for him but We thought we can handle it together when the time comes.

So this was a shock, I told him to please wait and that we can handle this. My exams were really close at that time and my future depends on it so I literally begged him to wait.

Days go by and around the mid of March he calls me again (drunk) and tells me he wants to marry me asap. He will leave his parents and demanded I should leave mine too. WHAT. I'm from India so living with parents is normal. But this guy says I should not even invite my parents (who approves him and met him multiple times) to the marriage.

I was in SHOCK. I did NOT want to marry a man who has me in the far bottom of his priority list. And the way he treated me gave me an insight on how my life will be if I married him. I said no I'm not gonna marry you now I want some time. I told him how he had treated me and that I wasn't sure if it was really because he was busy. And also I have exams coming up.

And when I tell you the words that came out of this man was so bad I was fuming. I am a very very patient person and this guy just broke my last straw. He started gaslighting me that I SHOULD marry him as I loved him and that I have too many expectations. Mind you he got me NOTHING on my birthday and on our 1 year relationship anniversary even when I told him I liked to buy and receive gifts. I got stuff for him and I also pay for our meals sometimes so I'm pretty sure I am not a gold digger. He started swearing at me for about 30 mins. I said its over I didn't wanna be with him anymore.

But the next day he calls me and said he didn't remember what he talked the night before cos he was drunk. THE AUDACITY. I broke up with him saying I don't want to go through that anymore and guess what he slipped some sentences from last night's convo, he actually remembers it all!

And I have him blocked now. It is really hard though, I loved him so much but I am clear enough to not go back to him.

PRESENT DRAMA

So I have a guy best friend whom I have known for almost 10 years. He is attractive and he also finds me attractive. He asked me if we could have a one night stand. Both of us didn't want any commitment. He is in the army and that also makes it impossible for us to meet regularly.

I was in my post breakup phase and said yes to him. I really wanted to focus on myself and have fun. But then recently I feel bad. I want to go for it but at the same time I don't want to. We have talked about the day and planned it all. It felt good, I was having fun talking to him.

But I'm still not over my ex (I am NOT going back to him). And I'm really confused if I should just go for it or not. I am not the kind of person who does one night stands but I really wanna have fun this time. But the inner me is conflicted.

Last part of me destroyed forever,"It's been 9 months and the feelings haven't changed. I've tried. I've tried so hard. Don't ever tell me I didn't. 
But it didn't matter. It didnt matter.
The last piece of my happiness was stolen by my ex, whether they meant to or not. Really, I think deep down inside they could've cared less if their actions broke me. Maybe if they thought of me, they would a little. But ultimately their feelings were always more important. They don't care that I was single for 8 years prior to this for a reason. They can't grasp the scope of my destruction. But really, they don't want too. 
 I'll never have any sense of normalcy now. Every second of everyday is a living hell. I'll never escape this. I'll never see people the same way again. I thought I had seen the most human behavior. I was wrong. APATHY is the most destructive emotion a human can have. Avoidents.  
never...and mean never, date an avoident. Even if they seem caring and loving, and maybe on some level they are..it wont matter. They will never care enough past their own anxieties to love you the way you deserve.

"To anyone who is suffering , maybe this will help","hey im a 19M, so i had breakup with a 21F its been 2 months since that and after the breakup we got close again , and when i confessed my feeling to her she shut up me , blocked me off  everything , i felt very hopeless and i for like 2 weeks i didn't eat , i didn't sleep , my mental and physical health deteriorated , i lost weight BUT .



It gets better , i cried , i went through every emotion there was .  i let it all hit me and i blocked her off everywhere , deactivated my socials , deleted every memory of us , i even had no one to talk to cuz i left all of my friends for her and she was my only best friend BUT 

after i went through every emotion i felt a peace within , 

so things to do 

1. drink water like 5l a day (cuz water really decides your mood)

2. get back with your friends (they will understand ""maybe"")

3. when ever you miss them just think about the reasons the breakup happened in the 1st place 

4. don't just distract yourself cuz when there are no more distractions the emotions will hit you like a truck 

5. THE BEST ONE ""GO NO CONTACT""

6. don't reach out even if you miss them (missing them isn't a choice , but reaching out is )

7. time will heal you for sure .

8. and don't worry life will get better , and maybe you will get someone who understands you better

9. maybe just maybe deactivate your socials and please stop stalking them , cuz it stops your healing process 

people who ever is suffering rn , pls remember ""you will get over it ""   

and my dms are always open if u wanna share your feelings or just rant about what happened

So instead of advice, let me offer this: ""Just breathe"". Just make it through this hour, then the next. Drink some water. Sit in silence if that’s all you can do. Cry if the tears come. You don’t need to force hope, but know that even in this numbness, your heart is still beating. That means something. That means you’re still here, and something within you hasn’t given up.  You are not broken beyond repair. You are not alone, and even if you can’t see it now, this moment will pass, not quickly, and not easily, but gently, with time, and with a little more light each day.

How do I get over an amicable breakup?,"Me (24F) and my partner (24F) have decided to go our separate ways after 9 years. It’s nothing to do with our relationship, it was almost perfect.

Hi i can’t believe im writing this so my gf and i are a year and a half together a month ago she went to work abroad for 3 months so we are long distance yesterday we had a fight which started from small things but quickly escalated and problems that were not mentioned for a long time came with it all, one certain problem which i have is medical giving me trouble to have proper sexual intercourse i should have solved it by now but me being ashamed to do so always postponing it and of course it ended up being the biggest problem, which we had agreed lastly for me to solve it while she is abroad. During the argument that too was brought up and me being emotionally shattered i didn’t  wanna talk about that in that moment. I ended up being outrageous a little which hurt her but i was hurt too. Today we spoke again about yesterday i proposed that we find common ground i said sorry many times for what happend the night before, but she said she needed time and distance.

I'm guessing she is having problems on her own and you should let her take whatever she needs. You should focus on yourself first before she texts you. You do focus on self care such as eating properly. Give your time to process your mind too.
Do I miss her or I just miss being in a relationship?,"So I (M24) broke up with this girl (22F) around 1 year ago after a 2 years relationship, and before that we were dating during high school which also ended up in a break up.

Anyway, I was the one who broke up with her but mostly because we were in a long distance relationship, separated by an airplane flight of 2 hours. I was finishing college and because of it i wanted to know for sure what i was doing with my future, and she didn’t plan to move to the same city as me in a long time, so I decided to end things as we had different plans for the future. She begged me not to breakup with her but

After 1 year - 10 months after our breakup she got herself in a new relationship with a new guy and that broke my heart as I was still alone and processing the breakup.

Currently, I’ve seen her insta posts through other account and I still think she’s very cute, but it hurts that we had to broke up due to life, not because I wasn’t in love with her, I had doubts and I have plans to move to other city in the near future.

Do you guys think I really miss her or are these thoughts only because she’s already with someone else and I miss being in a relationship?

Was I wrong for breaking up with her due to our lack of future plans? ",1,2,2025-06-28 06:39:51,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmg6z2/do_i_miss_her_or_i_just_miss_being_in_a/,,,You just miss being happy with her. It's a temporary feeling and it will be gone soon.

"I know this is long, but please help me! I need advice! BF 28 GF 34","So to kind of sum up things I met this man at work and we became friends and after about a year we started dating, he was all the things I was looking for in a man, and we got a long super well, same sense of humor, political values etc. He was super reassuring, I was in love he was in love, pretty normal. However I had a kidney transplant when I was 20…and they don’t last forever. Unfortunately, about 11months into our relationship (saying I love you) my transplant kidney rejected. Now I was fully transparent about everything when we were just friends about my illness, and then when this happened I had a convo with him about how things were gunna be hard and I was gunna be sick, and if he needed to pull back and we can be friends for awhile that’s ok. He said if “I leave you now I never loved you” (haha) any way life continued I was/am doing dialysis, he is still telling me “we’re gunna get married” “we can get through anything” “I love you more than anyone I’ve ever been with” I think things are hard but with him they are good, he’s super supportive. We are both nurses btw. We don’t live together, my family is kinda of traditional so that’s not my thing until marriage, he didn’t care. 

Then in Jan2025 I had to move back in with my parents out of my apartment cause I was just struggling, but I still went to his house as many days a week as I could. But I’m doing dialysis 3x a week…but he Golfs so he does that when we aren’t together. Things are a little boring, he works nights so he’s sleeping all the time, we aren’t alone a lot (he lives with his sister/BIL/niece) but life is continuing and I just think eh it’s our first rough patch we’ve gone through worse things we’ll get back to normal soon. Our 2nd yr anniversary was May 21, we talked about getting married, made sure we were on the same page, then 3 days later he ended things. 

I had texted him earlier that week saying I felt like he was a little down, sleeping all the time, I was worried he was depressed. He said he was feeling kind of down but trying to hide it. I said well let’s talk and see what we can do together to work through it. That’s I thought we were doing when we met up to talk…the first thing he said was “you’re not gonna like this conversation” the breakup lasted 30mins and he was gone. He mumbled “what if you die at 50 and leave me with a kid” (I’m 34 and have no issues except kidney failure, other than that I’m relatively healthy) and “I don’t wanna do this anymore, I’m not happy”. I was completely blindsided, he NEVER said anything to me about being unhappy in our relationship. He has since gone no contact. Won’t answer texts, calls nothing. His sister and BIL will talk to me but they don’t know what happened either. But they say he’s made up his mind and won’t change it. 

I think he is an avoidant personality, he never complained about anything to me, and I kind of had to make sure and be the one to bring up “relationship check-ins” and he said he struggled with that in past relationships. But that didn’t really bother me because he was so forthcoming about his love and our future. 

I’m confused, idk what happened, or what to do. Why didn’t he just talk to me?? We hardly ever had a fight, it wasn’t toxic, no one cheated. wtf happened? I miss him so much, and I miss his friendship. He was my best friend. 

Also, I adopted a dog from his mom, March 2024, when I first got sick cause I was unable to work and he thought it’d be good to have a companion and something to do. And he said he’d help cause it was gunna be his dog too, I footed the bill, he’s registered to me, and the dog lived with me. However like I said I had to move back in with my parents, and they didn’t want the dog at their house so my BF said he’d watch him. I was honestly struggling at that point to take care of him anyway, which wasn’t fair to our dog. For the past 6mo he’s been with him. But i obviously was down there as much as I could be. Well now we aren’t together. I still need my parents help so I can’t take our dog from him. But I miss SO much. I love our dog. I wanted to come see him 2wks ago and I found out from his mom that my Bfs sister has been complaining about the dog so she offered to watch him for a couple weeks (seems like convenient timing) she lives an hour away from me and I still do dialysis 3x a week so it’s hard for me to do much. 

So I don’t know what to do. I feel like he’s still my dog and I know I can’t take care of him, at least not right now. My BF loves him and I’m also not a petty person to take the dog when I can’t give him a good life right now. But I still want to see him. I don’t know how to handle this. I need advice!

My girlfriend broke up with me,"Just wanted go get this off my chest. My girlfriend just broke up with me and i feel very horrible and used.

We haven’t been so long together, but we have seen each other almost everyday since january. And now in june we just got back from holiday for 2 weeks. When we got home she was very distant and not herself. Then 5 days later she wants to break up with me and says she is not ready for a relationship and struggles a bit with her last relationship and was very clear with me that i was a rebound for her. I feel very used and disgusted. Felt like she backstabbed me and my family. My family is also very disappointed.

I feel very weird because she said many times to me that she wants to be with me for the rest of our lives and reassured that i was the one. Apparently everything was a lie. I haven’t slept anything tonight because im so shocked.

"It Wasn’t a Romantic Breakup, But It Broke Me Just as Bad — How Do I Move On?","I know this might not be a “traditional” breakup story, but it feels just like one to me.  
I lost two people who meant everything — not because they hurt me, but because my own mind ruined everything.

FZN was my best friend. More than a friend — a brother. Someone I trusted blindly.  
When he got close to someone else — ATC — jealousy hit me hard.  
I felt replaced. Forgotten.  
But instead of talking to him, I shut down. Became distant, cold, moody, and selfish.  
Even then, he never left. He stayed patient. He stayed kind.

ATC was kind, too. But I expected too much. Constant attention, instant replies — things she couldn’t always give.  
I got upset when she didn’t meet those expectations. When I saw her bond with FZN grow, my insecurities exploded.  
One day, I showed up at her office for an internship hoping for a simple acknowledgement — but she didn’t even look at me.  
That moment broke me inside.

After all this, I spiraled.  
I stopped studying.  
I failed exams for the first time.  
I hated myself for how I acted, for ruining something that never deserved to break.  
But they never disrespected me. They never pushed me away. They just stayed… silent.

I don’t know how to move on from this.  
**How do you forgive yourself for hurting people who never hurt you?**  
**How do you rebuild after breaking down and losing what you loved?**

If you’ve been through a breakup like this — where you lost someone you depended on emotionally, not romantically — please share your advice.  
How do you heal when your own mind was the one that broke everything?

The Letter He’ll Never Read,"Dear A,

We had a love that was unforgettable in the beginning. I still remember our first date, how nervous I was just to get through dinner. You helped me relax by ordering my favorite tequila, extra añejo, like you already knew me. I was dressed to impress, and you showed up in a plaid long sleeve shirt. What was supposed to be a short coffee date turned into a full night of adventures. By the time I got home at 4 a.m., I knew something had shifted. It felt right. Like we’d found something rare.

I thought I had found the one. My soul felt at peace. My body felt safe with you. Every moment with you felt like the best moment of my life…until it didn’t.

When the honeymoon phase ended, real life hit harder than either of us were ready for. My daughter wasn’t prepared. Skeletons started falling out of closets. And little by little, the glimmer in my eyes began to fade as the truth started to show.

The abuse started subtly. Boundaries you once respected suddenly disappeared. People you said were fine for me to be around became off-limits. If you weren’t invited, I couldn’t go. No makeup, suddenly there’s a dress code to follow. The yelling started. The accusations. The paranoia. And then… it turned physical.

Pushed to the floor. Slammed into walls. Hair pulled. Hit, though “it was not that hard otherwise you’d be dead,” you’d say. My phone, broken four times. My work laptop, smashed. An Airbnb, damaged. Through all of it, I was the one getting you help: rehab, detox, mental health support. Tried everything to help you get back up from your feet. But nothing stuck. You kept spiraling, and I kept losing myself.

You accused me, again and again, of sleeping with other people. Despite everything, I stayed. I loved you through it. I clung to the hope that something might change.

And then came the Bumble account.

You said I “killed you” the moment you found out. But you don’t understand you were killing me, every single day. Slowly, silently, painfully.
Yes, I made a Bumble account during the four days we were broken up. No, I didn’t go out with anyone. I didn’t give anyone my number. I deleted it quickly. I was just… desperate. I needed conversation. I needed someone to remind me I was still worth something. That I wasn’t the “trash,” the “stupid,” the “piece of shit mom” you kept telling me I was.

I shouldn’t have been searching for that in strangers. But the truth is, I was shattered inside. And I was trying to find a sliver of warmth that used to come from you.

All I ever wanted was to love and be loved in return. But you took advantage of my kindness, my loyalty, my nurturing heart and gave me fear in return.

A part of me still longs for you. But not the you I know now. I long for the version of you that made me feel like home. Not the monster I came to fear.

I don’t know exactly how I’ll move forward from here. But I know the right thing, the thing I owe to myself, and to my daughter, is to do it without you.

Even if my heart still loves you.

Even if it aches.

Even if the grief shows up in waves.

Because love is not supposed to hurt this much.

And I am finally learning to love myself more than the idea of someone who couldn’t.

Goodbye.

What to do when you realize you were unwell/the problem,"My boyfriend and I broke up in February/March. In that time, I was drinking heavily and would text him asking for help/closure. He would respond in an amicable way, but affirming his boundaries of wanting space, and I would respond emotionally and with anger. 

Our breakup was mutual. Honesty, I don’t remember much of 2025. I know I was extremely unwell and going through additional trauma while the breakup was happening. 

But I look back on our messages before he blocked me on everything, and I realize that I was the problem. I don’t remember saying all of that. I don’t even remember feeling that way. 

But it’s hard to move on- the “his loss” attitude doesn’t apply when I have so much guilt about my behavior in the end. 

Has anyone else been through this? What do I do? I am in therapy and working on all of this. But I am so deeply traumatized by losing this person who was my entire world and who my entire life was structured around. It’s going to take years to heal, and I’m not sure if I’ll ever heal fully.

"[F21] He's 34M — I left him before, he cheated, now we're both hurt. I still love him, but everything is falling apart.","I (21F) am currently in a complicated situation with my partner (34M). We’ve been through a lot together. We broke up once before — I’ll admit, I was selfish back then. I left him to prioritize myself, but deep down, I hoped he wouldn’t let me go. I was expecting him to fight for me, to make me stay — but he didn’t. He just let me go.

Eventually, I realized I still loved him deeply, so I reached out. We started talking again and reconnected slowly for about 3 months. But then, he cheated on me. I found out because he stopped communicating one night — we had spent the whole day together, and then suddenly, nothing. Later I discovered the truth, and yes, it broke me. Still… I forgave him. I tried to understand him. He told me he was lost, frustrated, didn’t have a job, and his mind was all over the place. He said he felt safe knowing I’d always be there. But over time, I started to feel like I didn’t matter as much anymore. Like I wasn’t a priority. I was mentally exhausted, full of doubts, and always overthinking. Then, one day, my ex (a girl — yes, I’m BI) reached out. We met. She knew I still loved my current partner, so she stepped aside. But I never told my partner about it… until my ex told him herself. After that, he confronted me, and I admitted everything. He was hurt and disappointed. He said he still loves me, but he needs space. He told me, “If we’re meant to be, we’ll find our way back.” I’m devastated. I never meant to hurt him. I still love him so much. He even told me he felt how unconditional my love for him was. Despite everything, I’m still willing to stay and fix things — to forgive, to move forward. But now, I’m the one who’s lost. I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing anymore.

Need help with a breakup,"Me 28M my girl 31F whom dated and I have introduced to my family and she have introduced to her family has broken up with me. We used to talk 12 to 14 hours.

Two Years Down the Drain,"Hello all! Please excuse the very long winded post. I (23M) recently got broken up with by my (21F) ex-girlfriend of roughly two years. This came as a bit of a shock, as all breakups are. Until now, everything seemed rather peachy! Sure, we argued just about as much as any other couple, but we were always quick to communicate and come to an agreement. Otherwise, things seemed fantastic! I truly thought I found ""the one"" and was even making some engagement plans. However, there was one immediate, glaring issue. We had just entered long distance as of May, where we would be a 6 hour drive from each other. Initially, this didn't seem to be a huge issue. My plan was that we would rotate who goes to who every two weeks. Thus, there would've been minimal burnout and we would've seen each other on a fairly regular basis. This worked better in theory than in practice. Unfortunately, she was not able to afford either the gas or plane ticket because summer break from college just began, and she is hunting for an internship. This was no problem, as I bought a plane ticket to fly her up to my state because I drove to her place last time (the plane ticket would've been a surprise). Unfortunately, the distance was too much and she broke up with me on the 25th.

To her credit, the distance was going to be for a very long time. I recently commissioned into the Army, and will be traveling across the country at the whims of the military. Whereas she plans on settling for a postgraduate program in NYC. Furthermore, my contract with the service is about 7 years long, so not insignificant by any means. I was in the midst of working out a plan to be able to see her by strategically using vacation days and long weekends to fly to see her, but she saw this as too vague and inconsistent. Who can blame her? She was probably right. This was too much for her, so she broke up with me. To be fair, I chose this life, not her, so I don't have the right to blame her for not subjecting herself to nearly a decade of uncertainty. But I still loved her so much, which makes it hurt so much worse.

The breakup was over the phone. Tough, but fair given the circumstances. She cited how miserable she always felt when I wasn't there. She said that she loved me too much to not be with me on a regular basis. She spoke about her experience during a deployment I was sent on to Eastern Europe and how miserable she was during that (again, very fair). She said she doesn't want to endure that again. To me (in my delusional, post breakup opinion), this seems a touch contradictory. She loves me and hates not being with me so much that she has to break up with me? Odd. Seems like there is something more here.

Through the tears and sobbing tribulations, I made the ultimate mistake of breaking my own rule, no contact. I called her the following night and morning after with clarifying questions. Please note that I have been very understanding and respectful in this entire endeavor and have not ever questioned her decision to do this or have asked her to take me back (which was very, very difficult). I've learned from a previous breakup that anything other than this leaves you feeling like a fool in a few months, so I approached this with that memory in mind. Anyways, she disclosed to me that in our time of long distance, I haven't been communicating as much. This has been a very valid argument, as I can be pretty independent. Moreover, she said that I wouldn't make the necessary sacrifices for her and that she felt neglected. I asked for examples (inappropriate in hindsight), and she brought up that I don't like to go out and ""party"" anymore. Aside from the fact that I have to be up at 5:30 every weekday for work, I have kinda grown out of partying at local college bars. This was in combination with a few other things she brought up, which are probably perfectly reasonable and fatal errors on my part. However, I felt like I did an OK job all in all. When we lived in the same town, we practically lived and did everything with one another. When apart, we called for at least half an hour almost every single day. I know distance makes things difficult, but what more could I have done?

Therefore, this leads me to believe that she fell out of love with me some time ago. I think the distance factor was an excuse to preserve my feelings (I am appreciative of that, by the way), as the true reason behind her leaving me was gaps in my character.

Nonetheless, I miss her a great deal. She was the greatest friend and partner I've ever had. I wish nothing but the best for her. Ideally, that would be me, but I can try and settle for her moving on to another man (excuse the crude joke). It is my hope that someday, during the no contact, she will call me back, begging to be with me again. Of course, I will say ""no"" and tell her that I deserve better (I am, of course, lying. I will cave instantly).

It's my greatest fear that she will move on quickly and start seeing other guys. Though none of my business, I am insecure at the moment, so I ask that you all excuse my opinions. I just want her to read my mind and call me. I want her to apologize for being silly and to say she was wrong, but in my heart, I think I know that I am the problem, and I think she already emotionally left me some time ago.

Thank you all for your time. I apologize for the lack of coherence. I did just get dumped after all. For all the young men out there suffering through this like me, I stand with your lamentation in solidarity with you. This absolutely sucks, but hey, we ball.",1,3,2025-06-28 04:36:22,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lme6h3/two_years_down_the_drain/,,,"Once again, my most sincere apologies if this story makes no sense. I feel it appropriate to say that I am undergoing rapid cognitive decline. And I can positively say that I am, without a doubt, losing my marbles. ||| I'm really sorry to hear that.

Sent this goodbye letter to the woman that I have to let go.,"I wrote this in my notes and wasn’t sure if I’d ever send it. But I’ve been carrying it with me for a while and I need to let it go. This will be the last message I send.

I truly think you were the first woman I ever really loved and maybe could ever love. Not just a crush or infatuation, but something deeper and real. I know this seems really pathetic, but you were also the first person I think who's ever actually loved me. You met me at a strange, vulnerable time in my life, when I was still trying to make sense of myself, my emotions, my worth. I wasn’t in a good place. I know I wasn’t always easy to be close to. I let my insecurities and weaknesses get the best of me.

You were this bright light during such a dark period, and that meant everything to me. I’m not saying this to pressure you or hold onto something that’s no longer there. I just need you to know it was real for me. and I don’t regret loving you, even if it came with some pain. Still, despite everything, loving you was the most alive I had felt in so long. You saw parts of me no one else ever really saw. You understood and brought out the softness in me that I kept hidden from the world, out of fear. Like it was safe to be vulnerable and have you hold me in your arms, virtually. You mattered to me. You still do.

It is hard watching you go on without me and not knowing what we could’ve been in a different lifetime, with different timing, and it hurts that the version of me you carry might only be tied to pain and chaos - because there was also so much beauty and care. I hope somewhere, deep down, you felt that too. 
I just want you to know I’m still here quietly rooting for your happiness. Even if we really never speak again, a part of me will always carry love for you. The kind that doesn’t ask for anything back. the kind that just…stays.

You were my comfort, my softness, my person for a time, and losing that has felt like losing a piece of myself. I hope you remember a little piece of us with some softness too. Crazy to think it's almost been a year since we met.

I am happy for you by the way, it might be bittersweet on my end, but I mean that. If you've found someone who makes your heart feel safe and full, then that's all I could ever want for you. I hope they know how lucky they are and see how special you are and gives you all the love, peace, understanding and happiness you deserve. You’ve always deserved to feel cherished. I hope you can heal from all of your traumas in life. You are an incredibly strong woman and I am so proud of you. Thank you for allowing me to know you, the good parts, the rough parts, and everything in between. I wish you all the best, Rebecca [middle name]

What to do when you (27M) lost the love of your life (27F) today,". Nothing about our situation makes sense to me much. Maybe someone can sort out.

1. I am feeling worse than I ever have in my life. But I wasn't broken up with. I broke up with her.
2. I **desperately** want to be with her. The emotional intimacy. The physical intimacy. It was the best of my life. Period. I know people who are in good marraiges, great marraiges, but they always have that one person they fantasize about being with. It was her.
3. She wants to come back.
4. I know I could, but we'd just be in the same cycle. I need an intellectual connection and she can't give it.

Nothing else in the world seems so cruel. There's too many maximums. She's the person I care about most in this world and want the best for. I'm feeling the worst of my life, and she's feeling even worse because I rejected her. I feel like I would do anything to make her feel better but *I'm causing the pain*. There's nothing I can do? Just sit still in suffer? Nothing else in life is like this. I feel *so* helpless.

Trust me i regret it a lot. It messed up my self esteem and I keep chasing her by begging and becoming desperate and devastated in front of her. Convincing her isn't enough so it takes long to convince myself that I lost her.  I highly suggest to not chase after her when she is really done with you . You are gonna drag yourself hurting very slowly and deeply by chasing her and you will regret after seeing the outcome. I suggest accepting everything at first and start to move on. It's normal to feel the urge but it's not okay to chase over her. You should start doing healthy activities such as journaling or taking a walk outside. It helps a lot. ||| If she said she never wants to hear from you… that’s a pretty strong boundary that she set. I know that must fucking HURT, but it’s best to respect the boundary and maintain your self respect. I know the feeling of wanting to reach out. I would advise to call a friend, you writing here is a great start too. You can also start a journal where you tell her everything you want to express or write a letter, but don’t send it. This could be a beautiful way to heal. Hope this helps! ||| It's so weird because last night I dreamt about her. Dont remember the whole dream, but I do remember us hugging each other and her saying that during the whole break up and everything she loved me through it and has loved me from the very beginning. I then pulled the classic Han solo and said I know. Its so funny that I dreamt that after writing this post out."
He made sex feel safe.,"(Trigger Warning: Mention of a previous sexual assault !!!)

In my teenage years, I was assaulted. Since then, I have always struggled with intimacy. The idea of sex was terrifying to me. My only association with it was pain and fear.

He was so damn patient. We took everything at my own pace. He was my first everything. He showed me that sex is supposed to fun, not painful! That it was supposed to be loving, warm, and feel good! He always prioritised my pleasure over his own. He always checked in on me and asked if I was alright. We would shower together after sex, and giggle while we washed each other's hair and bodies.

Now he is gone. The man who saw my deepest and darkest fears is gone. I bared my soul and body to him. I can't help but feel betrayed. I have never felt more vulnerable with someone. The idea of having sex with someone else, having to go through that process of revealing my past and deepest fears all over again is scaring me so bad. I'm not sure if I can ever feel go through that feeling of vulnerability ever again.

I am scared that the next time I have sex with someone, it'll be like all the times before meeting my ex  - violent, angry, and painful. I am scared that no one else would have the patience he did. It took me 7 months to muster up the courage to do penetrative sex with him. It took me another 2/3 months to be fully comfortable with it. What if no one else would be willing to wait for me, like how he waited?

My body yearns for him. His big and warm hands, his touch, his smell, his smile, his soft voice asking if he should stop whenever my body freezes up. Sometimes it got to be too much, I'd ask for a break, and we'd cuddle for a couple of minutes. His body was so damn warm. My complicated relationship with sex made me feel like I was inherently broken, but he'd cup my face and feel like I was the only woman in the whole wide world. 

While our break up was fairly amicable, due to both of us having inherently very different personalities and needs, I feel so betrayed. I showed you the most shameful part of me, and this is what I get in return?",2,3,2025-06-28 00:28:07,Trigger Warning,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm9m3b/he_made_sex_feel_safe/,,,"I hope that someday you don't see this as a betrayal, but that you look back on it fondly, as more of a learning experience.

There are other patient men out there. ||| Well it might be difficult but you definitely will be able to find another patient man.

How do I navigate this situation im in? Gave everything for her and she made me leave.,"To put this into context, I've been with this girl for a little over a year. Our love is extremely strong. It is both our first serious relationship, she is 22, and I am 23. We met each other in college. Loved each other hard and damn near immediately. It felt so right. I met her parents before we even started officially dating. She made many mistakes in rhe beginning, doing things that were close to unforgivable, and most people would leave (never cheating or anything like that from either of us). And I accepted those mistakes because we had been telling each other we see a future with each other and love each other so much and can't wait to get married and have kids. Her family all agreed I was the first boyfriend they officially met and was like, damn, he's a good person. She finally found someone good.

Fast forward to 3 months ago, we move to a new state together. My family is back where we used to go to college, and her family is in the new state we just moved to. I have no one here but here. This is where I start to make mistakes. She also has her best friend move in with us (horrible idea), and she hates me as well. The tables have turned, and I'm the one making mistakes now. And because of that, she decides to leave and wants to grow, but apart. She says I am too reliant on her, and haven't made any new connections in the new state, but she has her best friend and her entire family at her fingertips. My family and friends are 15 hours away. We took this leap in life because we thought this would be forever. And now she is making me leave, because she thinks I will never grow for myself, and love myself FOR myself. I wrote her a letter, pouring my entire heart out on paper. Begged for forgiveness and a chance. It wasn't enough. Moving out tomorrow...

Do I still allow the door to be open for reconnection later in life? I know there's some missing pieces that people on here won't know, but of course it's too personal to go on the internet. We both still love each other very much, and will miss each other. We have two cats together too, and I'll be back in a month or so to come get one of them that I paid for. Just can't take him right now due to the circumstances. Do I grow apart and never look back? Or do I allow the chance for it to be something again. Obviously I want the latter, but I don't know what's good for me right now.

I'm starting to believe that most of my relationship problems and trauma would've been avoided if I was just a bad guy.,"Anyone else have this curse where you always end up dating a woman who's ""never been treated this way before""? In my younger days, I saw this as the greatest honour. To be here first good guy, to be the one who proves her wrong that all men suck, to give her hope. Now, whenever I hear that, the first thought that comes to my mind is ""crapdammit, not another one.""

As I'm sure most of us know, the moment you her something she never had, she shows you exactly why she never had it. And I'm really confused as to why I'm still suffering this cycle because I'm aware that in this life, you attract what you are, not what you want. And I took two years away from dating to intentionally work on bettering myself. And I didn't even do all that work to have better luck with dating, I did it for me. But I still hoped that once I put myself back out there again, there would be as much of a change on the outside as there was on the inside. But no, still the same story every freakin time. 

Maybe my problem that I was changing for the better, when I should've been changing for the worst. Those type of guys clearly play the dating game on easy mode anyway. Unfortunately, I have too strong of a moral code to be that type of guy anyway, so my only recourse is to just cut my loses and play a different game, since love wasnt made for me.


_*EDIT*_

Before I log off and leave this steaming pile of a clown show to burn itself to the ground, I'd like to take a moment to separate the real ones who heard me out, from the bitter ones who projected onto me.

To the real ones. Thank you. Thank you for the taking the time to understand where I was coming from, empathize with my frustration, share your own similar experiences to assure me that I'm not alone in this struggle, and even those try to help me unpack my frustration and find a solution. Your empathy is what keeps spaces like this alive and encourages more open and vulnerable dialogue from those suffering in silence looking for someone to help shoulder their pain. You didn't twist my words. You didn't tear me down, you listened. And that means more to me than any solution you could have provided. Which a lot of you did.

Now to the others. To the ones who didn't come here looking to add to an open and honest conversation. To the ones who saw a man opening up about his frustration with an ongoing pattern in his love life and felt the need to tear him down for it. The ones who let their unresolved traumas be the driving force of their comprehension skills when dealing with men, let me be clear.

I am not your ex.
I am not the guy who manipulated you, ghosted you, abused you, cheated on you, or whatever he did.

I am just another man who was brave enough to speak openly about something I've been going through and actively doing the work to overcome. I didn't come here seeking validation, pity or praise. I came here to unpack, much like everyone else in this subreddit. 

But you, you didnt come here to understand me. You came here to use me as an emotional punching bag for your own vindication from the injustices you suffered at the hands of a man from your past. You find it easier to imprint your toxic ex onto a total stranger and aim your resentment at him than healing.

If all you got from what my post was that I hate women, or I'm an undercover F boy, then that says more about you and the stories you tell yourself in your own mind, than it does about me or anyone else. Yall will be the same ones who pester men to be more open and vulnerable only to respond to their open hands with closed fists like they didn't read the undisclosed fine print which states that our vulnerability should be expressed on your terms. You're free to be as maladaptive in your perception of reality and men as you like if it helps you sleep at night. But what you're not going to do is conflate the imaginary villain you created in your mind with the man in real life just telling the truth.

It sounds like you are the one being drawn to a certain type of woman. You may be choosing women who you feel will make you feel needed, or women you feel you can fix.

People can behave good and bad 👉  How old are you?   Is it possible that you are attracted to women with a certain type?   You’re quite general in your post. Nevertheless, can you go back in time and change your behaviour to women?  No. So no point to contemplate. Unless you’re thinking you should be the ‘bad guy’ now ||| you would have to have a pretty low view of women to actually believe this.   it doesn’t make any logical sense that women prefer men who treat them worse.  this is a myth.    there are many reasons why a woman could happen to end up with a man who is a bad person.  for just one example, that side might not have come out until farther into the relationship.  it does not happen because women intentionally seek out men who are bad because they are bad.    ultimately you should be a good person because it’s the right thing to do, not because you think it will help you with dating. ||| I had the problem that we had a kid 4 years into our relationship. We were high school sweethearts. I was only 22 when our daughter was born. And since we had a daughter I had it in myself that I really need to make this relationship work.   My ex was a very jealous in paranoid woman and I honestly felt that she would have learned to control that side of her better if I had dumped her early on in the relationship. Instead I kept trying to make the relationship work answer her insecurities didn't get any better (She had a rough childhood). I felt like she was taking advantage of the fact that the stakes are much higher for a breakup because we have a daughter and in turn that caused me to reset her.   Instead of learning from her issues which would pop up once every 2 months (huge and insecurity fights), She would learn that all she needed to do was give me time to calm down and act like it never happened. No matter how hard I try to make her work on herself.  People learn when they've lost something good and I never taught her that. It's not like I felt like I needed to be a bad guy but leaving my ex defend for herself with my daughter really felt like a bad guy thing to do. ||| I had a similar thing with my last ex. He said how he never felt so safe so quickly and strong. How I was so different to his other girlfriends before who were (in his words) toxic etc. He also discarded me via text.

I think I have a strong saviour/helper complex and tend to think that I am only loveable if I am needed or work for the love. ||| Could you unknowingly have a saviour complex and are somehow connecting with women who are seeking that out? Whenever there’s a pattern in your life, it usually starts with you.

As there are a whole lot of fishes in different seas, I'm sure as long as you keep living up to yourself, staying curious as you explore humanity, you will find your gem 💎   Good luck and dun lose yourself and your integrity into all these karmic relationships, some ppl are just here, meant to be a test in your journey of life. ||| Let the evil come into the world, but not through me :) ||| To preface I did read everything you had to say OP. And while I’ve come to a place where I wonder what I’m doing wrong after hearing situations where there are truly disgusting and manipulative people in these horrible relationships. The answer is not to not act like an asshole, sometimes someone isn’t ready or for whatever reasons it doesn’t work out doesn’t necessarily reflect on you or your behavior but becoming bitter and thinking I need to be an asshole just puts you at their level. I think I need to work on understanding that better but I understand it’s really hard. I’ve heard the same thing about finally being the good one or someone that treats their partner right and I’ve still seen how it ends poorly. A partner treating you as if you were an abuser when they would tell you what they been through is a miserable feeling and then you see them jump into something else is not a reflection of you or your character. That is on them and the best thing you can do is move forward as horrible as it is. Be patient and stick to your boundaries, don’t settle for less and understand your worth."
Breakups,Has anyone ever experienced breaking up with someone because of your differences? What did you to get them back? (She gave me 11 months to win her over) ,2,0,2025-06-28 00:00:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm91qh/breakups/,,,
Can someone who uses tools to improve their English still give emotional support if the feelings and intentions are genuine?,"This might sound like a strange question, but I’d really appreciate some honest thoughts. I’m not a native English speaker, but I’ve gone through a lot in life, including heartbreak, betrayal, healing, personal growth, and rebuilding myself from the ground up. Because of that, I often feel deeply connected to people who are struggling emotionally, especially when they’re going through breakups, grief, or feeling lost.

Sometimes, I want to offer support and share my experience, but I worry that my English isn’t strong enough to express exactly what I feel in my heart. So I use a tool to help me write things more clearly and grammatically correct, not to replace my voice, but to translate my thoughts in a way others can better understand.

But recently, I saw comments on here that made me feel disheartened, things like “*we want real people,*” and it made me wonder:

1. Does it make my words less valid if I use a tool to help express them more clearly?

2. Is it wrong to want to support others using the best version of my voice, even if it’s supported by a tool?

I use my real emotions, memories, and insight, just made clearer through technology. My intention is always to be kind, helpful, and human. Have any of you felt the same? Or do you think it’s okay as long as the heart behind it is real?

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from people who’ve been on both sides of giving or receiving support.💛",1,1,2025-06-28 03:40:19,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmd7ed/can_someone_who_uses_tools_to_improve_their/,,,"i think people will appreciate what you have to say either way! if you’re worried about seeming less human, maybe you could just mention that english is not your native language and that is why you are using it? i’m sure people will be completely understanding and grateful either way"

Need some major help,"I 19M need some advice. I've been with my girlfriend 22F for a year . We're both full-time college students and work as well — I work nights in a professional setting, and she works days at a fast food restaurant. I truly believe I love her, but over time I've been feeling more and more unhappy in the relationship.

One of the things that really gets to me is her short temper. She gets extremely upset over small things — for example, if clothes aren’t put away by color or if something doesn't go exactly how she wants, she’ll get an attitude and become really short with me.

I understand that money isn’t everything, and I don’t mind being generous, but it’s starting to feel very one-sided. I make significantly more money due to my job, and since we started dating last August, I’ve paid for every dinner and date. She rarely offers to pay for anything, but she doesn’t hesitate to spend money on outings with her friends. Even when she says she’s taking me out, I usually still end up covering the bill while she just leaves the tip. It just feels unbalanced. but at the same time i know i make more money so at the same time i understand.

Things started to shift for me around four months in when I found out she had been texting other guys. The messages were clearly flirtatious, and she had sent them sexually suggestive pictures — no nudity, but obviously meant to seek attention. What really hurt was that these guys didn’t even know she was in a relationship. When I questioned her early on, she insisted they were just coworkers and became defensive, which only made it harder for me to trust her — even before I discovered the full extent of what was going on.

I truly believe she’s changed when it comes to seeking attention from other guys — I haven’t seen anything like that happen again since. But despite that, I’ve been feeling more and more emotionally distant. It’s gotten to the point where I had a dream that we got married, and in the dream, I completely regretted it — I felt trapped and miserable. That really shook me. I don’t fully know how to make sense of it because I do love her, but at the same time, I’m starting to question whether love alone is enough when I feel this disconnected. just looking for some insight.",1,2,2025-06-28 03:23:35,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmcwwv/need_some_major_help/,,,"if this is something that you want to save, talk to her about how you’ve been feeling. be completely honest about how her actions have hurt you, but how you want to try and work together to build the relationship back stronger  if this is something you can’t see yourself staying with, seek advice from your loved ones who know your situation better than us. but generally it’s about being upfront and honest rather than dragging it on to avoid the situation  you know yourself and your situation best, so take some time to truly think about what option is best for you. either way i promise you’ll be okay. life has got a way of working itself out. you’ve got this!!"
She listened to her friends instead of talking to me,"Long story ahead 

Hi! I just recently broke up with my gf for 2 years ( 3 years this November ) I don't have anyone to talk to about this and I hope everyone here has some advice to give about break ups. 

I’m 26 (M) and my gf is 29. We’ve been together for almost 3 years now but we have lived together for more than a year. Our life seemed pretty stable, we both earn more than the average salary in our our country. We have financial commitments and furbabies that I take care of. I admit that I am nowhere perfect in this relationship and so was her. Communication has always been our problem ever since, she’s someone who doesn't want to talk after a fight. We had so many petty fights that we fixed or moved on without having to talk it out. 

Just earlier this year we had so many petty arguments and her action is to always say she’s moving out. At first, I didn't pay much attention to that cause I know she won't, we have so many things that bonds us together. 

Just recently, she asked if she can go out to on an island trip with her work friend and I let her because she looked like she needed some rest and she also wants to accompany her depressed friend who wants to visit another mutual friend who lives there. Everthing seemed fine but when she came home she somehow changed, I felt something was wrong, I felt that she was cold. We were just chatting earlier today, she was sending videos but then suddenly she came home without even letting me know. So, I let that be, thinking she might be tired of the trip. Day after that was her work day, in the morning, she was okay but then after her work she came home without letting me know and did not even talk to me. I let that go again cause she might be tired, she’s always tired because of her work. Day after that, she never spoke to me not even acknowledging my presence. Messages are just seen with no replies. So I confronted her and asked if I did something wrong, she did not reply just read. 

Right then and there, I was confused, what could I have done wrong? We were just okay. I then messaged her and said I wanted to talk, she replied she wants to move out so bad. So later that night, I confronted her and asked if she doesn't like me anymore. I was looking at her face as she tries to answer my question, I asked her again if she don’t want me no more and she could not answer, just a face of hesitation. So, I confronted her about something I knew, just a few months ago, I noticed she unfriended me and unfollowed me on her socials, she also deleted our pictures together and I have always noticed that she never included me in her stories no more, that’s when she cracked. Lately, she had been stressed and her responsibilities were heavy, she said she was looking for a partner but I was just a boyfriend material. She pointed that I never listened to her, I was always on the phone if she tries to lash out. I had no excuse, we did have that argument before but also because she never listened to me when I try to talk. She also pointed out that one time she needed me but I came late and I tried to reason out that I was even sick but I still came. She also pointed out when she tries to complain I always have something to say or an opinion instead of just listening. She then said she realized while she was away with her friend, they  opened up to each other and friend probably told her to break up with me( idk ) because of my mistakes. I cried cause I realized that she already fell out of love, I saw the signs and ignored it. She already processed her moving on phase but she just don't have the guts of breaking up with me.

I got to admit, I am happy go lucky person but that doesn't mean I didn't try to help her in her daily life that she failed to see and consider. There were so many things that I could say against her but I was just so disappointed that her perspective of me is now different. I was so sad that I could not even reason out anything anymore. I said sorry if I was not able to meet her expectations. She said she’s also aware of her lapses. 

Tho, at the end I did say she also didn't show care to me ever since. There were so many instances( even got into an accident that I almost died and seemed like she didnt care )She doesn't even listen to me but if it is her friends saying it, she would. I told her if you only told me this before or confronted me before we got to this, we would have been able to fix this but instead, you talked to your friends and listened to them. At the end, my life and my goals was always built around her, but to her, I was never a a part of it, a disposable. 

But then again, if I also did try to confront her before, if only I wasnt so afraid of making arguments about things we should fix about our relationship, maybe we would not end up like this. Destroyed because of not communicating and communicating to the wrong people.

I’m not okay with it, but I do understand.

I’m taking my accountability while also accepting of how hurt she truly is. But I will say, after long text conversations and constant messages.. I feel like it’s time we have the conversation of “ are we actually going to try and rebuild or do we just officially go our seperate ways?” As bad as the pain hurts to lose each other, the constant battle everyday on not knowing what the future can hold makes it all worse.

My “friend” is hanging out with my abusive ex.,"Guess she’s an ex friend now too?

I broke up with my emotionally abusive ex back in December after he lashed out at me for not giving him $5, which I knew was to buy beer. He is an alcoholic, lost his job several times, threw up blood, etc. I finally set a boundary around not giving him money anymore because I felt that I was enabling his addiction. He lashed out at me, called me a bunch of names, said he hated me etc, he cheated on me as well. After he lashed out at me, I said we were done and he could come get his things, he proceeded to tell me that he took pills and was going to end his life if I didn’t show up - this was a recurring thing that would happen. I always wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, but he’d lie to me about going to therapy and aa.

I finally blocked him in January and he proceeded to contact my roommates to try and get in contact with me, threatening to show up at our house, resulting in us needing to get a security camera because he previously slashed my last roommates tires. (She was crazy but that does not justify it.) And I have been no contact with him for coming up on nearly 5 months now. 

No contact has helped me a lot but there are some people involved in this friend group with him who I tried to stay friends with because I valued those relationships, however it seems they don’t value it the same way. I told the two girls in the group who I thought were friends, Sarah and Hannah, everything that happened with my ex and they even saw the messages he had blew up my phone with and they were shocked. Hannah informed me my ex hadn’t been paying her boyfriend rent for months and she was upset (this was in March.) 

Then, a few weeks ago, Sarah texts me and invites me to her birthday party but says my ex is going to be there and she “totally understands the situation” and can let me know when he’s going to be there so I know when “all’s clear.” I replied and told her thank you for the invite but I don’t feel very safe going if he’s going to be around. She ignored it and never replied, two weeks go by, and today she posts a video of her hanging out with him and joking around, laughing while he’s helping her move something like wtf? 

Am I crazy here? I already felt angry with her because she knows he’s an alcoholic and is inviting him to her birthday where there’s alcohol, then on top of it expecting me to work around that. 

I just am feeling super lonely in all this and like everything that happened to me is being minimized.

"Did I walk away from something real, or was I just overwhelmed and avoidant?","Hey all — I could really use some outside perspective. I recently ended a 2-year relationship (6 months official) with someone who deeply loved me and consistently showed up for me. Since the breakup, I’ve been feeling waves of sadness, guilt, doubt, and now confusion — wondering whether I made the right decision or if I just panicked and ran because of stress and internal pressure.

Some background:

I’m a 27M military member facing a lot of career uncertainty right now — potential moves, frequent travel, and trying to figure out my long-term goals. That pressure has weighed on me in ways I’m only starting to understand.

My ex (27F) was incredibly loving, loyal, and supportive. She went out of her way to show love — doing small thoughtful things, being physically affectionate, trying new things, and genuinely trying to grow for me.

At times, I felt like we weren’t on the same emotional or mental page. I’m more oriented toward personal development and navigating life’s uncertainty, while she was much more focused on building a future together and was willing to adapt her life to mine — even the unpredictability of the military lifestyle.

I’ve struggled with emotional avoidance — holding in concerns, avoiding conflict, and postponing difficult conversations. I also rely too heavily on things like nicotine and caffeine to stay socially and mentally engaged while numbing negative feelings. She encouraged me to quit, and while she meant well, I resented it at the time, and it caused tension.

I’ve also felt unfulfilled at times — socially and lifestyle-wise. I craved more adventure, independence, spontaneity — things I felt more connected to when I was single. She didn’t prevent me from doing these things, but I often lacked the energy or drive to pursue them while in the relationship. I now realize I could’ve communicated that more clearly instead of internalizing it.

She didn’t fully mesh with my friends or family in the way I hoped due to being shy. I sometimes felt like I wanted someone more naturally outgoing or emotionally resilient — especially given the demands of military life. But with all that said… she loved me deeply, and she made it clear she’d stick with me through anything. Even after the breakup, she said she still would.

We had amazing memories, and when we were just together, one-on-one, things often felt calm and affectionate. But I had this growing gut feeling that I was emotionally boxed in, and that staying wouldn’t be fair to either of us long-term.

Since then, I keep asking myself:

Was I just emotionally immature and avoidant?

Could things have been different if I had voiced my needs earlier?

Did I walk away from something most people never find?

Or was I recognizing a deeper incompatibility that love alone couldn’t fix?

She still says she’d take me back if I changed my mind. And that’s killing me — because I don’t know if I should. I’m afraid I’ll miss her deeply and regret letting her go. But I’m also afraid I’d go back only out of guilt or longing, not clarity and true alignment.

Right now, I’m giving both of us space to reflect and get clearer. No contact, no rushing. I want to give this the seriousness it deserves.

If you’ve ever gone through something similar — emotional avoidance, overthinking, breakup regret — I’d really appreciate your perspective.

Right now, you have stepped away from something real. From what you write out she is amazing and mature, and its clear you both love each other very deeply. But at the same time, despite its strengths, the relationship had some limits. I imagine you feel stuck, and that you guys are just fundamentally incompatible. And thats not something to ignore at all.  What are your answers to those questions you've been asking yourself?  And also, do you miss *her*, or just being loved and feeling secure. In other words, if it was someone else who was loving you who perhaps had some of those compatibility traits, would you be happy? Or do you want it to be *her*?  Lets say she wasn't willing to take you back. And that you were alone now. How would you feel? Would you want to go back? And if you did go back, what would be different this time? Are you able to communicate? To be there emotionally? For yourself and her? Good luck mate ||| Idk man I think you are making some problems bigger than they are.

unsure and frustrating,"my boyfriend broke up with me a week ago, i understand i wasn’t what he wanted in his life, and i get that i can’t do anything to get him back, if he wanted to come back, he would already, but it’s so hard to not fantasize about him talking to me again, wanting to see me, wanting to explain himself and fixing things. it’s such a setback, im like a roller coaster of emotions and i’m in between denial, anger, and acceptance it’s so frustrating, i want to get over it already but i can’t if i think about him so much. 
One part of why im feeling like this is cause i didn’t get the answers i wanted when he ended things, he told me he wasn’t in this relationship anymore, i didn’t fit into him image of his future, but i can’t understand it, by his words, i was the love of his life and we were in steady ground. He was fitting me into his future, he initiated every talk about moving in together and said he was excited for it, it left me in a shock when he said it to me, why would we date for so long if i wasn’t what he wanted then?

You should come up with a list of questions, and then ask him if you can talk with him just for closure's sake. People grow and change. It's hard to accept that. I'm trying to accept that too.

Like in general, and perhaps specific moments? * When did you start feeling this way? How long were you contemplating it? When did you make the decision to end it, was it yesterday? * What was your main problems with me, and what do you think I could have done better or differently?    * What did you feel like you needed from me? * Do you still see a vision of us working, or does it feel like something that has closed?  * Is there part of you that is doing this to avoid guilt and pressure? * Why didn’t you tell me sooner that you were feeling done? * Is there anything you’ve been too afraid to say to me until now? * Do you think we could’ve worked if timing or circumstances were different—or do you think we just weren’t right?"

Every little thing he does annoys me and i just cant stand it anymore. i really dont know how to leave him because im terrible with comfrontation, i know i want to say that things have been changing in our relationship in a good way but i dont feel any different.  

I really want to explore what life has for me but im unsure that its a good choice and if i should stay with him, i feel like its a obvious answer but i really have no idea how to go about it. 

with everything said I could really use some advice on what i should try to say, what to do once everything is said, where should i do it, and just any advice would really help me figure this out.

If he was that bad, why didn't you left him earlier? Why did you made commitment and promises knowing you can't fullfill them? Love is about commitment,its about staying when your relationship is at lowest. If you truly think you both don't love each other,then have a mutual breakup  Just don't scar another men just because you don't have feelings left for him anymore ||| if you’re fantasizing about leaving more than loving him, you already have your answer  you don’t need a perfect speech   you need one sentence and the guts to say it once  “this isn’t working for me anymore and i need to move on”  say it over text if in-person feels paralyzing   do it somewhere you can leave immediately   then block and go cold turkey   no drawn-out closure convos   no checking in   no guilt  you’re not breaking a promise   you’re breaking a pattern that’s draining you ||| Have the discussion of true separation, be strong and walk away before you get bitter for staying. I’m saying this because it sounds like you do want to move on you just need to get out of your own way to do it. Explore life and love and just take this relationship as a lesson for finding what you want for yourself. As someone who stayed, I envy that you are aware enough that you are seeing you have options. Good luck! 🍀 ||| Once trust is broken it’s very hard to get it back, I’d say move on before you resent him. ||| OP, i know how you feel, i had it the same way. Soon this annoyance will turn into full time resentment and not only it will damage the relationship even more, it will hurt you as well. Trust is a pretty fragile thing and sometimes it is hard or even impossible to regain it, especially when u are still holding onto past events or don’t see enough effort from another side.  It is hard to leave someone you love or used to love, someone familiar and close to you, but sometimes it’s the right thing to do, prioritizing yourself is extremely important when relationship can’t offer you something you are looking for anymore. Leaving sounds scary, but losing yourself by staying is way worse. Life has a lot of things to offer and it will take some time for you to adjust after you have left, but it will be so worth it! You deserve a relationship which helps you stay afloat, not the one which makes you drown. ||| You are way too young to be trapped in a relationship you clearly don’t want  Just leave you’ll feel the biggest relief! Good luck ||| Well, do you care for him in any way? ||| You are 19, your life is really just beginning 💖 It’s a valuable time to learn that no matter how long you have been with someone, it’s never too late to make leaving worthwhile  You owe nothing to this guy (or any other) & it is as much his responsibility to keep you happy as it is yours to not hurt him. It sounds like y’all have already tried everything you can but it’s just not working out at this time in life.  In terms of logistics, always nice to have an escape route so perhaps not your place. Either his or a quiet spot in public like a park is best because you can extract yourself whenever you want. If you have to kick him out of yours or rely on a ride home from him after, that’s just setting yourself up for an awkward time lol  Picture yourself as an employer letting go of an employee who is not the right fit. It’s not about blame or mistakes, focus on the things that simply refuse to work properly in your relationship. Be direct & honest but not harsh or mean.   “I’ve been thinking a lot lately…” is a classic breakup intro that they might see coming & cut you off to try to stop you. So I suggest leading with something like, “This relationship is no longer working for me.”  Then you give him 2-3 reasons why.  - I thought I could rebuild our trust but it turns out I cannot - We don’t have fun together any more - There is not enough room in my life to be the person I want to be & remain your girlfriend. - I’ve stopped looking forward to spending time together.  It sounds cold but if you’ve ever had someone leave you with little to no explanation of why, then you know that’s a lot more cruel in the long run. Don’t apologize, over explain, or feel required to give examples. It’s not a negotiation.  Womanhood is realizing repeatedly in life that a lot of our time gets wasted by walking on eggshells around men. And 95% of the time they will make you regret it anyways lol  At the end of the day, if he were in your position do you think he would he would hesitate once his decision was made?"

Having a hard time coping imagining her with other guys,"Exactly what the title says. She was the only girl I was ever intimate with physically, and she left me essentially to have no strings attached in college. I’ve heard she’s already speaking to new people.

I messed up and went the full desperate mode.,"So my girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me after a really bad night of fighting about her parents hating me. She broke up with me in that moment and I left driving when I shouldn’t have been and said some things and almost did something that would result in me not being here, with her on the phone. But it’s now 4 months and I’ve exhausted all means after being blocked in everything the day after when I found her out with her coworker for dinner. I tried all other socials, *67, email, a letter. And at the end of the day I’m still so sad but also have been focusing so much on my health. Therapy, daily working out, and other things. I just want to say that I disregarded everything everyone said in this thread and did all of the desperate acts over the past 4 months and I’m starting to regret it and everyone is right. Do not do it. Nothing works when you don’t focus on yourself seriously. They left you. Regardless of the problems I thought that love and promises would prevail but no. You’ll go through phases of blaming them, yourself, and everything in between. But just learn to love yourself and what you want will come.

I broke things off and now I still feel awful. Need some words of encourgement or at least someone to slap some sense into me.,"To give some context：

I was “dating” him for about little over a year and he still did not ever DTR. At the start of it all I made it clear that I wanted a relationship. He was the one who proposed dating for a year so I gave it time, naively thinking he will make me his gf after that time. A year passed and he did nothing.

During this time, I noticed that he was way comfortable physically than having any emotional connection (maybe just with me or he has avoidant characteristics). We went from seeing each other a few times a week to now once every other week. He never ever reached out to me during the week tho was present when we saw each other. Whenever I reached out he would take hours to respond or not respond at all. We talked about the same few topics that he was comfortable with and there just seem to be a wall and I could never get to know the real him.

Looking back he has always been like this and I think a big piece of why it will not work, even if he DTR is because of the lack of communication. Every time I try to bring up my feelings, he avoids it or makes it my fault.

And so I broke it off with him and called him out on the way he had treated me but I FEEL AWFUL. I know I made the right decision to stop wasting my own time because there has been no progression but it’s like my heart still misses what little breadcrumb he gave me. 

I have accepted that we want different things and this whole time he more or less treated me like a Fwb and an option.

How do I get over this??

All of the above. Not only does it keep your mind distracted, but it expands your horizons and boosts your self-esteem."
I want to breakup with my gf,"I’m 17M and my gf is 17F. I don’t want to be with her anymore. Her parents absolutely suck, they suck to me, they are verbally abusive to her, and as selfish as it sounds, i can’t take it anymore. She’s the one who has to deal with it, which i feel absolutely terrible about, but getting so many phone calls of her balling her eyes out and being mad at them for the stuff they’ve said to her gets hard to deal with. I needed a break, and break didn’t help. Besides this, I never get to see her. We just recently graduated, and before then, I wouldn’t see her for longer than a minute at school, she’d come up to me for a few seconds to say hi, then run off and talk to people who she hates. She talked to them because she “wants to have friends” but she also hates them at the same time and tells me about how much they suck. They’re incredibly rude to her and they don’t like her, and she doesn’t like them. That’s done now but it’s confusing why she’d choose to talk to them for a full year instead of seeing me at least a few times. That being said, there’s always outside of school when we can hang out right? I guess not because i only ever saw her once or twice a month, if even that. She’s always too busy for me and she texts me and calls me, but yet she can’t hang out with me. Her parents push me over the top with how they treat her, it’s atrocious that they’d talk to someone like that, let alone their own daughter, now i don’t know what to do. I honestly just can’t be there for her anymore, it’s too much on me. I feel awful saying it and I know it’s awful but i really just can’t have this around me. I am from a calm, humorous, and fun household, thankfully. And i will forever be grateful for that, seeing this is incredibly heartbreaking, and knowing that there’s nothing i can do to help is even worse. It’s come to a point where i just want to get up and leave her, I feel as though i’m damaging myself by staying, but id also feel terrible by just leaving her, understanding her situation. I also don’t want us to end up like how her parents are, angry all the time, they don’t talk unless it’s a fight. I need some help deciding. I’m very young and I don’t want to leave her but the negatives outweigh the positives by a large margin. I never see her, her parents are the absolute worst, she hangs out with her “friends” she hates when she has the time instead of seeing me, she’s moving on to university so I won’t see her much because she’ll be too busy. There was this one time when we were at a store, and i asked if they could unlock the case, and the worker there said “i don’t have the key since it’s my first day, i’ll call someone over, though” and she was for some reason really upset and was lowkey rude to the worker, which i asked her to stop. I’ve also talked to her about all of these things that she does, she always says “i’ll be free in a few weeks!” and then those few weeks go by and something new comes up so she says it again and again and again. 

I need some help here I don’t see us going anywhere. Any suggestions on what to do will help. I’m sorry if i come across as selfish or anything like that, i really do apologize and don’t mean to come off that way, I just want to do what’s right for me.

As much as I want my partner back as i said to him, if he wants to leave, I can’t make him stay. The best advice I can give is try to do it in person. If you can’t do that, do a video call, then phone call. Try to avoid breaking up over texts as best you can.

She’s relied on you from what you’ve said and I think it’s good that she trusts you, but has she gotten to understand you? She isn’t making time for you which you NEED in a relationship. Distance can happen, but it should never feel like this. I feel it’s best to leave her for your own good. Some will say it’s selfish, but I think in this situation you need to choose yourself first. I’m really sorry for her circumstances with her parents, but you’ll never be able to fix that. It will be best to leave her because the relationship feels one-sided. A healthy dynamic needs 50/50 effort. Even if it’s not intentional on her end, you shouldn’t teach someone how to be a good girlfriend. That’s for her to figure out in my opinion. Best wishes to you and if you end it, it’s for your own good and maybe for her too."
Why do I feel bad?,Why do I feel bad when I recently found out that my ex had sex with multiple people a month after our break up?

Jordy,"You can keep playing games all you want. Block me on everything, post cryptic things so others know you’re available, etc. I am done playing your games. If you want to reconcile as adults and figure out our relationship; cool. If you want to keep playing then that is your choice. The first few days crushed me. The “space” you wanted cleared my vision. I am working on me. I am available for those that DESERVE me. 

I was not perfect by any means. Truthfully, this space opened my eyes to many flaws that I have. I acknowledge and am working on those. Are you working on yours? I know far more than you believe that I do (“your friends aren’t real friends”). I feel weak for even thinking about overlooking the past and starting fresh. My heart wants that but my head knows it is stupid. 

If you want to be mature and talk cool. If you want to dig your hole and play pity party then fine with me. Just like where we met, there are plenty of fish in the sea. I refuse to settle for anything that doesn’t meet my needs. You should as well. I’m ready to meet yours, are you ready to meet mine? 

As the Joker quoted in the movie, there is a timeline. You know that a circumstance occurred causing me to potentially sign a lease somewhere. If I sign that lease I will not break it for you.

So he still haven't finished his bachelor degree, he said he's going to finish it since the beginning of our relationship, but until now he still haven't finish yet and I haven't seen his progress yet.

Before anyone judge me, some country run different than other. In my country, to get a better paying job you need at least a bachelor degree. He's working right now, but he only earn so little that he still living with her mom and not really contributing to the household.


We have plan to get marry. In his current states, i think i need to wait atleast 5 years to get marry.

I then compare him with other people, said that they can get much more with the same positions as he is. He keep denying me and won't listen to me.

"I'm glad they're in the past, but I'm still hurting.","Long story for this one. This girl (25F) and I (25M) have known each other for 10 years. She lived in Austin I lived in Houston. We decided to actually try for a relationship and it completely went to shit. I recently got out of a break up and a thing we both always do when we have problems with the opposite sex is try to talk to each other to see what the other thinks. Well she broke up with an abusive guy some time in October while I was in a relationship with someone else. After things fell apart with the relationship I had we both connected in late February of this year. Well she decided to visit me out of the blue and spent a weekend in Houston with me. After I took her out to eat we went back home because she was tired from the drive then got intimate surprisingly. The rest of the day we just relaxed took a nap then went out for a drink. Next day it was to the museum which was fun. I was happy just to be with her. She wanted to go see the butterfly garden and it just meant a lot to see her smile especially after all she had been through before. After that I took her to a nice wine restaurant. Had drinks,  had laughs just enjoyed being around one another. Afterwards I drove her back to my house so she could drive home. Kissed her goodbye and told her to stay safe. I was obviously over the moon about it because I thought in my dumbass head ""this is it after 10 years we might actually be able to make something work"" welp after 2 weeks I visited her and stayed at her place in Austin. 

I drove out friday night after work. We watched bone tomahawk when I got there went out to eat and relaxed. Next day I replaced the bumpers on her car because no offense she cant drive great and austin roads suck ass. We went out for breakfast went hiking with her dog crackhead watched and the cidercade. Felt really relaxed and at the arcade she normally isnt really clingy or lovey dovey but she latched on to my arm and rested her head on my shoulder while we walked. My heart melted at that. After I get back and im getting ready to head home to Houston she asks if we could talk outside on the back porch. She then proceeds to say she regrets having sex and regrets basically us trying to start anything. Obviously my heart dropped. I tried asking why she couldn't even explain why literally saying, I dont know, which was probably a lie at this point. I told her look we've always wanted this why are you backing out now after 10 years of talking on and off. Just didnt make any sense and still doesnt. At that point I felt used for my ability to fix cars paying for literally everything while we went out like she told me just to come out here so she could use me and lose me. Crazy. Well my dumbass persisted. I really should have just dropped it there when she did. She agreed to give it a shot but it was the most half assed thing ever. Later on down the line she even said she didnt want to half ass anything with me, but we'll get there shortly. Things are going somewhat smooth we text and call when we had the time found myself being the only one trying to plan a weekend together to spend time. She kept going ""oh not this week I have etc."" Which i just told her to go enjoy herself. Well half the time it would be something important life spending time with her dad on his birthday or drama with her mom but the other half is raves and going out to bars or on Sunday allegedly rotting in bed and not doing anything. It would be believable because she does do that due to her depression but she also as i forgot when we were growing up. Everytime she is down she messages guys on instragram and acts really interested just so she has a chance of getting money or just the validation and attention she craves. I should have known because ever since we've known each other she would always talk about how she fucks with people. Well figured out I was now the person being fucked with mentally. She then proceeded to say she didnt want to half as anything with me over a somewhat break up text i agreed. Then afterwards she wouldn't talk to me or hold a conversation but would text me I miss you once every day for a week. Told her to stop and it hurts and if you dont want a relationship stop talking to me like we are still in one. Awhile after that how i know she is messing with other people, her friends started to message her because someone was messaging them about something allegedly only I knew. I still dont even know what the fuck it was. On the first in the afternoon she called me about it. Now recently I got a new job and drove all day and night the day vefore to get to it because I started that Monday in comepletely different state on nightshift. I haven't messaged her friends ever. Dont have there numbers haven't messaged anyone she knows on instagram because why would I bother wasting time begging for someone who already wants to leave. On top of that I had been driving for 16 hours straight and just got to a place and only slept 3 hours. She decides to spam call my ass demanding if im the one who was messaging her friends about something allegedly only I knew when in reality she's been messing with another dudes head all along. Told her i had been bassically up for over 32 hours at this point havent messaged a single one of her friends, havent had time to then hung up. Then sent a text saying if all youre going to do is message me with drama or accusations please refrain from doing so. Crazy how it works I dont know why I stayed in touch with them before I never tried never bought em anything never even really cared because I knew the distance wouldn't be good. As soon as I try I just get absolutely shit on. One thing she is right about is that our friendship and anything else should be ruined. Still though I feel horrible about it. Dont know why. It hurts more and more every day. For awhile I was doing ok focused on my new job exploring the new state I'll be in for a few months just relaxing. Yet it still claws at the back of my head with stupid questions like why couldn't she have just tried? Why couldn't she put more effort in? I used to not have any resentment about it but a month later its just hitting really hard now. I dont know what to do with myself I can barely even talk to people sometimes I just keep working. I go to the lake to fish on off days. I go walking on trails in the woods. I just dont feel like being around anybody. People at the new job want to hangout I tell em sure but never follow through. I genuinely just dont want to be around people anymore. Like everyone is a liar or a phony. Puts on a face to make themselves seem like a good person. My friends back in Texas I can barely bring myself to call. I've been talking to a therapist but they aren't really helping me right now maybe better help sucks but I cant find one in person because my job takes up most of the day. I just feel burnt out of face to face interaction. I didnt even feel like writing the whole stupid fucking story out because reliving those good and bad times hurt too much to keep journaling or typing out. If anyone has any advice on how to get over this because if I keep looking back I just start to hate them then back to stupid ass I love them and miss them. I dont know how hard it is to shake someone you've known for 10 years off of your mind but I hate it. I really fucking hate it.

Please console me,"hello everyone. i am asking for your help. i have been together with this girl for a long time, 5 years (long distance but it has always been perfect and the last months were the best so far). i got along great with her family, we went on vacation together and it was like something from a movie. yesterday she went somewhere with her family. at some point i fell asleep. i wake up and all of a sudden i am blocked everywhere. everywhere. we had some cute couple stuff like matching names on instagram, we had our vacation playlist on spotify, it was all perfect. all of a sudden, all of that is gone. her name went back to normal, i'm blocked everywhere. nothing of us is left. i texted her mom and she is very surprised. she said she will talk to her when she gets home. i have to say we had (<- it hurts to use past tense, maybe somehow there is still hope) a very God-centered relationship. we prayed a lot together, always talked about how God brought us together because we had so much stuff in common, it's actually insane. every conversation we had, we somehow found a way to talk about God too. one od the most beautiful moments on vacation was when we prayed together. we both started crying and hugging after. now everything is gone, our matching bios were changed into a "":)"" or into an ""old account got hacked"". she posted photos that i took of her. she had some very bad girl friends that treated her badly. specifically she mentioned that she was sad for never being anyone's best friend. she was my best friend and we talked all day every day. we always said those girls were evil and she always said she is happier than ever for being away from them. we spent so much time together and it was so beautiful. she always thanked me for bringing her closer to God and farther away from those girls. we both grew closer to God together. in fact we had another vacation planned in a few weeks that we got the tickets for 2 days ago? i am very confused, heartbroken and sad. can anyone somehow console me? please just anything. thank you very much and please, please help me and pray for me. this is the worst i have ever felt.",5,9,2025-06-27 18:21:17,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm149w/please_console_me/,,2 day(s),"1.

Honestly, it's challenging when your partner has controlling parents. It all depends on whether your ex is willing to fight for you. But given that you're at such a young age, I doubt it works. Two-way communication is key. Let your ex know that you're not comfortable with their attitudes & behaviour.       I know how hard it is to get along with parents when they can be straining your relationship. Take care :D"
Advice about post breakup,"So me and my exgirlfriend broke up about 5ish days ago, and somehow we got dragged into the same social event and whilst there she starts making all these claims when im out of earshot about how she cant wait to neck other men in the clubs and get laid in scotland, after a 5 days of being broken up from about a year and a quater relationship. I know i broke up with her but am i insane or does that just feel too soon? Was just feeling kinda hurt.",1,1,2025-06-28 01:46:28,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lmb4v0/advice_about_post_breakup/,,,"She's hurt bro and this is what women do or say to get revenge. My ex said the same thing to me out of the blue through text two months after our breakup and I hate to admit it but it really broke my heart. I get what you're saying, that if she ever did really love you how can she say this right next to you knowing It'll cause pain. Most Women run on emotions and act before they think. and Some people think that hooking up right away after a break up will ease the pain but in my experience that is really unhealthy. Go through the sadness, go through the anxiety of not knowing, the days where you can't eat and sleep. This is normal and temporary. After you process all these emotions you will see the growth in yourself as a person and will be wiser in your future relationships and partner selection. It'll be a rough couple of weeks mate, stay strong if there's someone you can talk to talk it out."

Just had my breakup,"He told me he couldn't manage both relationship and career at once. We both are aspirants studying for different exams. I was supportive, very supportive in fact that yes his mental health is very important and more important right now. I told him I'm always going to be here for him, I'll always love him and I do. Still it hurt, it hurts so much. He had initiated a breakup before cause he felt he was being an obstacle in my studies, yet I fought tooth and nail for him to stay. Yet today, he didn't fight like I did. He simply agreed that he might wait for me, which I'm not sure he will. Somewhere Ik he has lost feelings for me which sucks tbh, cause he was always the man I had always dreamed of, took care of me, never judged me, never even raised his voice at me no matter how disappointed he is. And now he is gone, he doesn't want me to text, to give him space to clear his head and study.

Maybe I'm bitter, but I did expect him to fight for us. Maybe even take a break, I wouldn't hace texted or annoyed him if he would have told me. But still.....idk how to manage these feelings.

Anyone else shocked they went through with dumping their partner? Plus a vent,"This breakup was different for me. I had started thinking about breaking up, I was feeling more sad and alone with him, but I thought maybe things would get better. 

I also started wondering if he was cheating. He was working way more hours but saying his job reduced his pay a lot. He didn't want to be intimate very much and was being rude to me (which he blamed on his job/money.) 

Still, I thought he was going through a rough time and I'd continue to see. Then one night when I asked about being intimate, I said I don't want to feel like roommates, then he got really mad and ran to sleep on the couch. In the morning, I thought he'd ask for forgiveness. Instead, he called me yelling at me for trying to be intimate with him and started calling me names. I ended it right then. I'm still in shock I went through with it.

He told me they broke up bc he thought she was cheating on him but I guess that turned out to be not true, hence the rekindle. Anyways, he was always talking about her and comparing our relationship to theirs. He was the one who brought it up and asked if it bothered me, I said it did and he has cut down lots. About 4 days ago he brought up how he ""doesn't love her anymore"" and he's happy now that he's found what he wants but that he has a lot of regrets for how things ended between them.

lost without him,"so my bf (24) broke up with me (18) almost 6 months ago, and I still can't get over it. we lived in two different countries, we met online and it was long distance. it was gonna take 6 years for me to move there, we knew it for a while but eventually he came to the conclusion he couldn't do it and broke up. he didn't deal with the breakup very well and went very silent on me when I wanted to talk, it continued right up until now. sometimes we talked but I only got to say like 5% of what I wanted to. a few days ago I reached out to ask how he was, got no reply, yesterday i once again asked him to respect me enough to either talk to me or unadd me, he chose the latter. it hurts and idk how to deal with it. he's the only person I've ever loved and can see a future with, I was willing to fight for our relationship at every step because that's what I believe loves about, but he gave up so easily. i've spent everyday hoping he'd change his mind but idk if that day will ever come. idk how to cope because im out of school and didn't finish very well, i am struggling to find employment, i have no friends or anything to do irl so I just am in my room all day. life feels super empty, he was the one thing I wanted forever no matter what and he was fine with just leaving. there's a lot of detail i haven't gotten into here because it's a very detailed story but i am pretty depressed and take meds, and i just want advice on how to get through life rn. i want to still hope for him to want to try again, but my life is very aimless and i often feel very hopeless and like nothing ever works out for me no matter how hard I try and I just want to give up. if anyone could give me words of advice or experience or just sympathise i'd appreciate it a ton :(",1,0,2025-06-28 00:58:50,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lma7xq/lost_without_him/,,,
Just numb. Is my reaction normal?,"My gf and I (both 22) ended things two weeks ago after a 3+ year relationship when I moved to a new city. Things between us weren't the greatest for a few months prior, but it's not like we were fighting, more like relationship stagnation. It felt like the right thing to do, and honestly I think I wanted it more than her. It's my choosing that we didn't do LDR.

It's been two weeks of no contact and I haven't cried since the day of the break up. I just feel numb. We were still very much friendly when we broke up and it was absolutely on good terms. We both expressed a desire to still be friends at some point, but we're doing a few months of no contact first.

I thought I was over it, I thought the months of knowing things would likely end soon helped me heal, but a girl asked me out on a dating app and I nearly had a panic attack. I don't know if it was just anxiety or guilt.

Every day I think to myself that I should be crying, I shouldn't be functional, I should be resisting the urge to text her. Sure, there have been times where I want to tell her something about my new job (which admittedly has kept me busy, at least for now), just text her a little life update or a photo of my food, times when I've checked her location (admittedly a bad idea to keep doing this) and times where I check if she's looked at my Instagram story. There have been times when I've been alone and felt sad. But mostly I've just felt numb.

This is my first break up. I don't really have a measure of how this is supposed to go. Is my reaction normal? I'm trying to get back into therapy to unpack my feelings, but right now I don't really have friends in this city and texting my friends back home just isn't the same.

I feel like I'm going through this break up all wrong and I don't really know what to do.

Is he REALLY over me?,"I am an woman (40, ADHD) with a complicated 8 month relationship with my (again) ex boyfriend (man, 37 AuADHD) and one year virtual friendship prior to that, while he was with his toxic ex girlfriend. But now it seems it is for real, he stopped following me on social media, and closed his account on Instagram so I could not see his posts (I blocked him, and his account was open again, so he could get more messages from women, but as soon as I unblocked him, he closed it again)That is not like him, he never did it in past relationships to anyone. BUT, he told me that didn’t want relationships with anyone right now, not just me (but our break up was a HUGE fight) and now he is taking professional pictures to post on Bumble and Tinder. He is not doing depressed posts on his Facebook as he use to do (thank God! I am genuine glad for him about this).

I did the no contact for a month prior to this break up, and it worked on him missing me and wanting to come back, but I manage the situation poorly and we got back more in love, but with the problems worse. 

That “I am so wanting to date again, be happy again, etc etc” is possibly a sign that he is going too fast because he is not over me at all? 

Is it possible to have a third chance? 

I suspect he is a fearfull avoidant. (And of course I am anxious, but don’t follow to all characteristics, but still recognizing it, because I had a fall back while dating him). 

P.S.: A friend told me that even that he doesn’t want to talk to me until next year, he said that won’t let anyone talk badly about me behind my back, that he would defend me every time he could, that the problem is just between he and I.

Broke My Own Heart,"(Please note this is a skimmed down version) Feb. 13th work was crazy busy stress was high. It was a our first VD together. I was to be off of work 2/14 because we are 1.5 hours apart and I want us to have the max amount of loving time, he also works second shift. While at work the team didn't do what they were supposed to do and I ended up having to go in the office 2/14 which meant I would not be able to see him. In my irrational women brain had the most negative thoughts of this is not going to work, I cant even spend 1 freaking day with him. SO I then proceeded to text him and say that it wasn't going to work and he asked if that was what I really wanted and I said no but the schedules are what they are. We had some time not speaking and I reached out to him explaining that wasn't what I wanted and explained at that time I was having a mini melt down, and I was stressed. He didn't want to get back together. which I can understand because I out of no where ended things, I probably hurt him.  I most certainly ended up breaking my own heart :( Now that was two years ago, we have spoke on and off over the 2 years but now we have been speaking every day twice a day for months.

To do that i have to let her go. A double edged sword. This is so frustrating.,1,0,2025-06-28 00:38:08,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm9t7n/trying_to_let_go/,,,
Was put on an Antidepressant,"Went to a therapist for the first time yesterday and she suggested going on an antidepressant (physician had to prescribe).  Didn’t realize my breakup-induced depression was so severe.  I have a unique situation that while I was dumped in late
February, I kept working with the girl till the end of May.  The therapist said I really didn’t start healing till I stopped seeing her everyday which has now been about 5 weeks.

Why the antidepressant?  I’ve lost over 20 lbs, terrible sleep, ruminating thoughts, and panicking, spiraling thoughts at times.  I feel ashamed and embarrassed that I can’t pull myself out of this but she said what I’m experiencing is quite normal.  So how say you?  This is my first foray into mental health meds (Zoloft).  Can anyone else relate? ",2,0,2025-06-27 20:49:38,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm4qp9/was_put_on_an_antidepressant/,,,
She left… but now she wants to talk again. I don’t know what to do.,"I was finally learning to live without her.

The late-night overthinking, the “what ifs”, the fake smiles — I was surviving.

Then out of nowhere, she messaged: “Do you hate me?”

I didn’t know what to say. Part of me wanted to scream “Yes,” but another part just wanted to hold her again.

She says she’s not ready for a relationship — just wants to “talk.” No promises. No future. Just… something.

But I’m scared. What if she’s just lonely? What if I let her back in and she leaves again?

Girlfriend slept with someone else during our break,"My girlfriend of 1.5 years and I broke up earlier this year for around 4 months. During that time she joined another couple for casual threesomes. Now we've reconnected and fallen in love stronger than ever. I love my girl and our sex life is great, she's definitely a nympho, and that's part of why I love her. I've accidentally seen a video of her having sex with the guy from the couple and some kinky details have come out. Normally I'm very open-minded and sex positive but this has kinda thrown me through a loop. She's amazing and is doing all the green-flag stuff with reassuring me and rebuilding trust.

Have I really lost my wife?,"I’m a 45M and my wife is 52F, we have been married for 4 years, together for 6.  Due to some health reasons I started to become more introverted, not wanting to go out, socialize and my wife is the complete opposite, love to socialize and travel.

TL;DR, without realizing I was no real help around the house and absent from her by not spending time with her.

It has now got to a point where I am 99.9% sure she has cheated on me (she stopped sleeping with me 6 months ago) and has now asked to separate.

Whilst I would say there was some fault on her end too, I accept that 80% was mine.  

I am desperate to win her love again and at the moment I am trying to change to be back to who I was before I became ill.  My fear is that she has gone past the point of forgiveness or just doesn’t want to.  The convos I have overheard recently that she had with her friends suggest she is done and just wants me out of the house, but her actions do not match that as I still sleep in the bed, and she seems to be less stressed now I am helping out more.

I’m just interested in any advice or views on this as my family think I’m a mug and that she is just punishing me for my lack of communication over the last year and will throw me out as soon as it’s “socially acceptable”.  Any help would be appreciated as I do still love my wife dearly, I am distraught that my actions have hurt her, but I want to make things right again and am willing to go to any lengths to do so.

Breakup today,"I just broke up with my boyfriend earlier today. (29 female) (37 male). We've been together for five years. On and off again for a while. Frequent arguments. Fact about us as a couple, neither one of us likes to be told what to do or submit to anyones authority, both stubborn. The reason I left him is because when he was playing Call Of Duty, a girl came up on the headset and I couldn't hear what she was saying, but he responded with ""Calm down honey buns."" This made me really angry because I told him I like to be called pet names and he doesn't consistently do it. Instead, he puts me down and devalues me and makes me feel stupid in subtle ways either by nitpicking or critiquing. Big verbal argument broke out and he told me he was going to leave if I didn't let it go so I turned around and say I was done and I was leaving after we both called each others names and berated the other.

1. It does get better, but it does not go away

2. Drugs and alcohol make it a lot worse. Not while you're high or drunk but the next days

3. Your friends and family are really all you have. No one else will fill the void

4. It's so unbelievably hard to do anything other than think of them, but you have to do it. Gym, instrument, new sport, new challenge... all of it.

After a hard breakup every rejection hits 10 times harder. You gotta keep telling yourself you wouldn't have liked them anyways.

Missing someone you love, someone who meant the world to you, is one of the hardest kinds of pain. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how much time passes or how rational we try to be, the heart still whispers their name.  You loved deeply, and that’s nothing to be ashamed of. Saying ‘I miss you’ isn’t weakness, it’s proof that what you shared was real, meaningful, and human. Even though it hurts right now, please remember that missing someone is also a reflection of your capacity to love, and that love, even when it breaks, is still something beautiful.  Take your time. Be gentle with yourself. Let the tears fall if they need to. You’re allowed to grieve, and you’re allowed to feel everything that comes with it. One day, the pain won’t feel this sharp. One day, your heart will breathe again without so much weight. But until then, please know, your pain is valid, and your healing will come, one breath at a time.  I want to share something personal, just so you know you’re truly not alone. After I broke up with my ex; someone I was with for many years, I missed him so much that I ended up calling him. But his new girlfriend answered and scolded me. It was humiliating, and it broke me even more. But I got through it.

Ex’s birthday,"It’s my ex’s birthday today, first birthday after the break up and we’ve been no contact for several months.

I want to wish her happy birthday and hope she is doing well in her life, and hope shes happy, but I know I shouldn’t text her as we stayed in touch for way too long after the breakup, it was very difficult to go no contact and now I don’t want to fuck up both of our heads.

So I wanted to wish her happy birthday here - you’re still in my heart, and I wish you nothing but the happiness you deserve.

I dont think breakups must force both sides to never even look at each other from hate disgust and resentment... (unless it was a toxic relationship, cheating or violence involved etc...)  It's an easy decision here imo.  Either you send it: - she replies and still thinks about you, you talk - she replies but just with a cold thank you - she doesn't reply  Or you don't send her at all: - you will now never know what would've happened  Think of it like cold approach to a girl on the street again. Maybe she will say ""yes i'll give you my numbe"", or ""no i have a boyfriend"", or you don't try at all and will never know..  The only bad scenario is that she doesn't even answer, but, that doesn't mean you should be sad, the sad one is the inhumane who doesn't even bothers to thank others for their wishes. So if she doesn't answer you can tell yourself ""good I lost her, even a cold 'thank you' she doesn't say"" but most of the people will respond to that I guess. ||| good call on the no-contact boundary   sending a message now would just reopen old wounds—*for both of you*   you’re right to resist the urge  this is a bittersweet part of moving on—wanting the best for someone but knowing that your silence is the gift they need   keep her in your heart, but don’t give her the power to disrupt your healing   she’s not your responsibility anymore  the best birthday gift is continuing to take care of yourself, no matter how much it hurts"
It gets hard but I know I’m okay.,"I grieve my ex so hard sometimes still even 8 months later. A part of me feels like what we had wasn’t what I thought. He moved on super quick and it hurt to see that. Still hurts and it’s what has me gobsmacked sometimes. And I know that it doesn’t matter because I also want to heal and move on. And that one day he won’t hold weight on my heart and mind anymore, I know this. I can imagine my life without him. I like the person I am becoming without him. When I was with him it’s like I was never enough. I felt that way myself and also he kind of made me feel that way, it’s like I was never doing enough, was never enough of something or too much of something. When he broke up with me I blamed myself for everything because I thought it was only me. But now I can finally admit there’s multiple truths. I failed to show up in many ways but also so did he. He hurt me plenty of times in the relationship and never took real accountability and never changed after I would confront him, he would apologize and say “I know I’m sorry” but nothing ever changed. I should have been happier and felt more supported this was nothing like I had imagined a relationship could be like. I only saw the good in him. And no he’s not a bad person just wasn’t good for me. Even knowing this I still have days where I have a hard time getting out of bed and only want to sleep, where I stay up all hours of the night crying and obsessing over him and where he’s at what he’s doing now, wondering why he hasn’t tried to come back for me. When he dumped me he blamed me, but also told me “you were always worth it” and told me “you need to accept it” and just was cold. He sent me a song that says “I know it's not my place
To ask you stay with me on Earth
I've heard Peter call your name
But Darling, I was calling first
So if you have to leave
I can't say that I'd understand
But, my love, I will wait (Like I always have)”. He walked around looking hurt like he was broken over us but to me he was cold, confusing and distant. He would tell me he had dreams of flying and how free he felt, when I went to get my things he was so happy and even gave me “do me eyes”, was happy to have his own space again. And I was doing my best to keep my composure and not cry to make it easier for him, so he didn’t have to put up with my despair. I was looking out for his wellbeing while my whole life was flipped around with vague excuses and all the blame on me. And what he blamed me for were my reactions to him constantly breaking my boundaries. It’s crazy how we can mourn people that aren’t meant for us but we still kind of wish they were in our lives. I’m proud to say I blocked him months ago and haven’t reached out to him despite how bad I want to sometimes. I’m able to get through it. The despair is so heavy sometimes I don’t know how I do it. In the back of my head I know logically that I’d be doing myself a disservice reaching out to him. That it would hurt me more than help me. That all I need to do is get through it no matter what my emotions are telling me because one day I simply won’t care about him. I hope that’s true anyway, I hope one day I can wish the best for him and not want anything to do with him.

I’m in the middle of a tricky breakup again after a few years together and we were truly head over heels for each other but one day we hit a wall because he stopped trying to work on things with me, among other shitty things that I forgave. Then I grew tired and got sick of feeling so alone and we were trying to work through something one night and I realized…we don’t care anymore actually, then we decided to breakup.

But then weeks go by and I see why I did. I found out all these insane lies she told me in the past, and then she started lying about me.   Two years and an engagement and I didn’t even recognize the woman I once loved. Heck after the lies I’m more sure now I never knew her at all.   She was cold, heartless, and told me how much she hated me.  And all I did was tell her I couldn’t be with her anymore and the relationship was starting to affect my life and mental health. It’s crazy how you see someone for who they are when you cut off access to yourself.   Relationships are supposed to add value to your life, not take it away.

I ended up signing a petition to the court to get it back a week later, and a week later, I canceled it. I texted her the next day and said sorry because I did it more out of anger than I actually wanted it back and how I'm sorry I don't want to be manipulative and how I hope she find someone who can be someone who can treat her better and haven't talked to her since. I still love her with all my heart and I hope nothing but peace and i pray for her everyday but Honestly, there isn't a way back from that, so I just accepted the loss and just moved forward.

Need tips: I’m meeting my him today for a “final talk” 2 weeks after he broke up with me through chat.,"I asked for this, he granted it. He said he fell out of love, but I consider this opportunity as my last to ask about things. Because the past few meetups we had, I was just so focused on listening and absorbing his feelings and his decision, finding an ounce of hope that we can still save what we have. I disregarded and set aside my thoughts.

I prepared an appreciation gift because I’m thankful and I’m rooting for him, even without me on the picture in his future. I don’t want to close doors on friendship because we were once good friends, but I just can’t right now that I’m still aching. There was no cheating, no huge fight, he just concluded our long-term relationship (almost 7 years) with reason of incompatibility. 

I’m scared to face him. I’m not ready to let go. But I also can’t stay in a relationship where I ask for a chance, get anxious, and walk on eggshells then sooner or later, he’ll again decide and raise to end this.

I want to end if ever in a good note. But this time, I also don’t want to mask my feelings anymore. Can you give me tips on how to prepare myself as I face him later? I’m scared.

Even my therapist agreed that I was still feeling my feelings but the thc gave me a different perspective. Would recommend. ||| It honestly depends bcuz you can be intoxicated and cause more damage, on the other hand, being drunk can numb you for a few and you go to sleep 💤 wake up and the pain is still there, i use to get drunk to numb my pain with my ex husband and I actually was hurting myself and he was somewhere being pleased so no matter what I did and how I did it, things seemed to have gotten worse bcuz I was losing myself while trying to figure out what happened to us and what did i do, all under the influence, I was questioning god as well bcuz of who I was to him and what he chose over me so,,, I laid in bed crying some days, walking up and down hills praying my way out and realized the person he chose to be with was on drugs, sleeping on skid row “ NOT JUDGING ANYONE SITUATION “ but she was a complete DOWNGRADE and that is what started helping me instead of alcohol, I actually started waking up bcuz I was sleeping on myself, that man was toxic and he actually had me turning into someone that I wasn’t, and he wasn’t worth it, I really could have lost alot behind this man and I deserved better, alcohol had me going on skid row with bull horns, running into police, just all sorts of crazy ish, I swear its not worth it, I actually helped myself by moving far away without him knowing where I stayed and fighting the pain from far, I couldn’t get to him that easy anymore and that did justice for me not the alcohol"
I Want Her Back,"I was in a long-term relationship for eight years. It was secure, loyal, and loving. We eventually broke up mutually as she was dealing with PTSD and unable to have children, and I was under intense stress at work. Our communication broke down, and over the course of our final year, we slowly drifted apart and it broke me.

Despite the breakup, we stayed close. We agreed to allow each other access to our dogs, which has kept us in regular contact for the past two years. I’ve never stopped loving or caring about her. She hasn’t moved on, and I didn’t enter another relationship until a year later. I didn’t feel ready still but it was an old friend I reconnected with but it only lasted six months and ended in her betrayal which hurt me all over again.

Recently, when I went to collect the dogs, I got emotional and broke down in front of her. I told her everything—about the betrayal, the grief of losing her, the death of a family member, and how giving up the house to her and our failed attempt at becoming parents had all finally caught up with me.

She was genuinely concerned. She reached out to my employer about her worries for my wellbeing, which led to me getting counselling. She even sent me the same material and resources that had helped her with her PTSD.

Since then, she’s invited me in when I’ve visited for the dogs. I’ve helped her with things around the house—installing her security cameras, doing some heavy lifting in the garden, even fitting a new carpet. Not at her request, but out of my own will seeing her struggling when I visit - she’s hyper independent and very stubborn.

In person, she’s warm, caring, and close. But it also feels… professional, almost. When we text, she’s distant and cold. It’s like there are two versions of her.

I want her back. I love her. I don’t know what to do.

I never know I'm that efficient, it only take me 1 day to finish it all...now I don't know what to do. Playing game? I got bored. Watch movies? also bored too. And new hobby requires money.

First love,"So this girl and I started dating 5 months ago. She was my ""first love""/first dating experience. With that she was the first person I slept with, first girl at whose house I slept, first time meeting parents in law you know the drill. I was really in love with her. (I found out she is an avoidant)

4 weeks ago she discarded me really hard. Like avoidants tent to do and now she acts like I don't excist. 

My question is, how do I cope with all of this. It is 5 weeks later but I still think of her and all the things we did together. It is not helping that she was my ""first love"" because people say those are the hardest to get over.

Any advice ?",1,1,2025-06-27 23:33:31,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm8hbe/first_love/,,,"Bro I just posted about this exact same situation. I feel your pain 1000%. My ex was my first love and we had only been together for 6 months before she pulled the pin on our 6 month anniversary because of mental reasons.  I’ve been receiving maybe like 1-2 text messages a day from her but they’re being sent to me as if I’m merely another human. I’ll ask her days been and if she did anything exciting, and she won’t reply for a day.  I got broken up with over text and I really need to see her again for that closure. I can’t simply just be disposed of over a text message when we created so many memories together, met her family and extended family, went camping with her brothers, met all her friends. Like this shit is no fair at all. And I’m also the one that was in love with her. Not once did she say it back, but I know she showed me love in different ways.   Keep your head up man and hopefully we both get the answers we deserve."
What did you guys do with all the plans you made with them?,"As the title says, i’m just curious what you all did with the plans you made with your exes. Something had reminded me yesterday of future plans that me and her had made together which spiraled into me thinking about other plans we made that i still really wanted to do.

We had always had the dream of buying a house in her home country and renting it / living in it from time to time. I watched a youtube video yesterday that just reminded me of it and this question had popped into my mind. I would still love to do that eventually, maybe by my self, or not, im unsure. 

Im curious what you all did with those thoughts. Did you just forget about them and let them die or do you still chase those plans by yourself / with another person?

What to say to a friend going through a breakup?,"My best friend just got dumped by her boyfriend of 4 months and no one saw it coming. We’re all in a little bit of shock, including her but I guess this last month he’s been dropping hints that he wasn’t sure he was ready for a relationship to begin with which is just a hard pill to swallow. My thing is I’m not the big touchy feely type friend, I sit and listen but I feel like for someone who is very touchy and lovely it’s not enough. I don’t think I can change that part of myself to make her feel better but what are some things your friends did/said that helped. I’m thinking of my own experience through this to, but for me I just wanted people to distract me and not constantly ask me how I was doing. However, I will admit, at the same time sometimes I felt like my friends didn’t care because I was always putting up that front. Her current state is shock (it was 2 days ago) and a little bit denial, so I’m just trying to mentally prepare and figure out how I can be there for her.

(Vent) I feel used.,"My ex girlfriend broke up with me nearly 2 weeks ago, we were together for almost 4 years. She said that she was thinking about it for 7 months. I feel used because she was hiding it from me the entire time, what she was processing in 7 months at her own pace, I have to process all at once. I kept giving her my soul, she was enjoying all the good things about me, while planning a breakup. It just feels so selfish to me… she could’ve at least talked to me about it. She kept me for her own sake, and I feel like she forgot mine. I tried explaining to her why this hurt me, but she doesn’t see anything wrong with it. I get that breaking up with someone is not easy, and that there is a lot of thinking about it involved. But why like this? The last month of the 7 months, her exams started. She told me she needed to think about what she wants, so I just waited and kept a spark of hope. During this period she wanted to stay in touch, but I had a hard time with that, because a part of me was preparing for a breakup. She visited me after her last exam, she told me it was over. She cried in my arms, realising it was truly over, she had never squeezed me that hard. It looked like she was scared or something idk. She even kissed me, I have never felt that much emotion from a kiss, it’s a kiss I will never forget. She also wanted to keep contact after the breakup, she wanted me to stay at her place in a few months when her parents are going on a holiday. I refused, because it’s either me, or no me, and not half of me, or only the good of me.

Fast forward to today: she told me some things that hurt a lot. She is always out partying, she told me she will use other guys as distraction. She told me the breakup doesn’t even hit her.
I am already sure I don’t want her back anymore. She wanted to keep on using me, just to ease her pain while mine grows. It hurts she thinks that’s okay. It hurts that she is living her life, while I am struggling so bad. I just hoped and wished her the best, but now I feel like I can’t forgive her… at the beginning I put so much blame on myself, and I didn’t feel like I was used. Now it’s one of the only things I can think about. How is this so easy for her? Why did she tell me that it doesn’t hit her. We had a 4 years relationship, and she is already open to use other guys…
She always told me she was disgusted by that kind of lifestyle, she was always talking shit about her friend because she always has lived that way. Just partying and drama. And guess what, now that “friend” is the person she spends most of her time with. It sucks, she changed to a completely different person, she dyed her hair all of the sudden, and in all of those 4 years she never dyed her hair. I spoke her a few days ago and she told me about her hair and sent a video of how it’s gonna look. I said 
“I’m happy for you, but it’s not my style.”
She replied: “Thats good, now you can hate me even more and stay even further away from me.”
I don’t get it, I don’t recognise her anymore. I deleted her number, I blocked her socials. I am almost 100% sure I don’t want her anymore. But damn, it hurts..",0,0,2025-06-27 23:29:30,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm8eao/vent_i_feel_used/,,7 month(s),
Still broken after almost 2 years," Gonna be a long one so thanks for reading. So me and this girl weren’t really dating but we both had feelings and almost acted like we did and it still crushes me today. We first met back in late January 2023 originally arguing about stuff, but we became extremely close come February 2023 voice calling for like 10 hours a day always telling each other everything and opening up about things no one knows about us. To this day no one knows more about me than her. No one has ever loved me the way she did or understood me. I was in disbelief by this because she was everything I wanted in a women. She meant everything to me and the reason I didn’t solidify it properly was due to being broke (our religion requires dowry) so I was trying to build myself up. 

 The only thing I didn’t tell her about was the fact I was extremely suicidal before meeting her, I didn’t tell her this because she told me her father died by suicide. Words can’t describe how close we were everyone knew and talked about it. Come late summer 2023 and she started random arguments here and there, she then apologized and said she was hormonal because she was on her period and I forgave her.  However this kept going on and on and sometimes would threaten to end our friendship which deeply hurt me, but again she’d apologize for it. After this continued into the fall I started to loose feelings coz I was tired of arguing. Eventually I land a sick internship and was happy for it. 

 But than end of October 2023, she messages me saying she doesn’t want to speak to me anymore because she was tired of initiating conversation. I told her that’s not the case and I been busy as an intern lately but she says the real reason why is coz she has deep feelings for me and know it isn’t mutual. I didn’t say anything because I was tired of the nonstop fights and stress. But we exchanged farewells and parted ways. Than December she comes back to my life but it’s super dry and boring so I removed her march 2024 (we didn’t speak since late January 2024). I did cry after she removed me initially but moved on after a week or two.

 Come late August 2024 and I see on social media she got married. While happy for her (and I did pray she’d find a good man) I was extremely crushed and broken by this. Was crying everyday and going for walks filled with regrets. Started to slowly and slowly get over her. Than got another burst of sadness this winter but then moved on again. During the spring I found out she’s looking for a roommate at an extremely low rent which (despite being a big jealous of her marriage Ik I’m a bad person and selfish) I felt sad seeing things not appearing to well for her. Anyway I want to anonymously send her money to cover her rent but I don’t have her number anymore and she deleted all socials. 

 Anyway I’m sorry for the long rant. I just been really sad as of lately because I never had a proper relationship after that and I never felt love like that from anyone before. Ik we’re both the reasons why this relationship fell apart (we’re young and immature) but it’s hard knowing one of the reasons I haven’t taken my own life walked away and is now in a hard time and I can’t even do something about it😔 I’ve been crying a lot and remembering the things we used to do together and it just feels empty now.

Want to hear your experiences Please!,"PLEASE READ/ RESPOND:
I would love to hear experiences of living together after breaking up, getting back together after being broken up with, or anything you might feel is relevant!!


So I (21F) am a week out from broken up with by my ex (21m) in my first long term relationship. I’ve broken up with others before, but both of those ended at 4 months. We had lived together with some roommates in a house we rented for college (met freshman year, lived together junior year) and supposed to live together again this year for senior year with one of the roommates. 

A week before he broke up with me he told me he had been feeling distant/ disconnected for a bit, even since living at the old place (not sure for how long) and was hoping the being apart this summer would do us good. We had still called every day though, so much time being apart. He said he wanted to work on it and still loved me. A couple days later us and our roommate went to his family’s camp. While there he mentioned he was still feeling distant, and felt a weird feeling in his chest that wasn’t like normal anxiety/ depression. He still said he loved me, I mentioned it sounded like a breakup and said “do you think I’m dumb enough to break up with someone here?” And he still called me his and “his wife” (a word of endearment between us). When we were leaving I had mentioned how we needed to plan when to bring our date nights back, and plan time to talk more about how we feel in the relationship. We got back to his house (me and roommate used to switch back to her car and shower) and he broke up with me, and I asked if he thought we couldn’t work and it and he said he didn’t think so. He was also saying he was getting more aggravated with me over stupid things and I didn’t deserve that. We were supposed to talk at some point about what happened.

People who know us are mixed. The roommate who is a friend to both of us has told me sometimes people just fall out of love. Some family on my side think he may come back, though telling me not to count on it. (They used example from their own lives). And say how he looked at me and used to do so much for me, even in the smallest ways. They also mentioned we probably spent too much time together, which I agree with. 

I’m mainly heartbroken because I still love him so much, and I’m only upset at him for not even giving us a chance to work on it. Our roommate already told him if we can’t live together (we would have separate bedrooms) he’s going to be the one to find a place to live. 

I promised my aunt, who’s been helping me and thinks he may come back (again, not counting on it but she is good with this sort of stuff weirdly) I wouldn’t reach out for 2 weeks post breakup. 

It’s so hard though. I see so many videos I want to send him, I struggle watching romance right now, which I used to love. I can’t watch things we used to watch together. I want to ask him why he thought we couldn’t work on it. How he went from still loving me to giving up. He was afraid I would completely change myself for him and I didn’t plan to, but I wanted to change and grow to make us work. He really felt like my person. I know we are still young and eventually it not hurt as bad, but I still feel so invested in him and his life. He had wonderful stories that I helped with designing characters, I loved his research, how he got so excited with things he loved and how he would light up and ramble on and gush about it. How he made me laugh, how he cared for me, the way his hugs felt so perfect.

is it over?,"we were together for 1.5 years and then got into long distance...2 months in we had a huge fight, i said some things out of line and got blocked everywhere, and i mean EVERYWHERE. Been 2 weeks now since we've contacted but i got the text below when he blocked me. I have been considering this a breakup. should i? alot of people suggested he did actually leave but didn't wanna be the bad guy so did it in a calculative way. I am stuck in this breakup/ not a breakup just a break loop. I cry almost everyday cause i miss him. I cry harder thinking it might actually be over forever. It hurts thinking i got played and i didn't even get the grace to be left with proper closure but instead just got blocked randomly one Friday.

Got back with my ex,"I got back with my ex back in March after we broke up a month earlier as he had been severely neglecting our relationship for almost a year. I am talking about like only calling me twice a week, canceling dates at the last minute, not prioritizing me. We got back together a month later when he drove flowers to my apartment, which was an hour from me and apologized and told me he’d been stupid and that he would be better. He was and still is better. He calls me every night and sees me every weekend, but at least once a week he says he only has time for a “5 minute call” and then frequently lets me know he has low energy. 
     Last night when he called and I picked up I asked if he wanted to talk that night and he said “aren’t I obligated to?” Made me feel kinda of crappy that my boyfriend is sometimes calling me just because he feels like he has to, but I don’t know what I expected when I originally broke up and got back together with him over phone calls and time together. He then corrected and said, “well most times I want to but sometimes I just want to relax.” I guess the thing is that I know he loves me to death, and I love him too. But I hate getting the scraps of someone’s energy, even if it’s for a valid reason like a demanding job. Our anniversary is coming up, and I’m not sure how I am feeling about it or even us. He thinks I’ve been shaming him or complaining, adding pressure and not being understanding of his situation. I wish he could see how much it hurts me that he does not let me in with his emotions or life, or to have little energy for me. I don’t know what to do. To add insult to injury, I just moved out of my apartment and back in with my parents to save money for school and so now the only way we can see each other is to meet in the middle or get a hotel, as his older brother who he lives with doesn’t allow guests over. My therapist said to return the energy he gives me.",2,1,2025-06-27 19:10:34,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm2c8r/got_back_with_my_ex/,,,
seeking encouragement after ending a 3+ year relationship,"i could use some encouragement/validation/support. i’m struggling to center myself and my feelings post-break up, instead worrying about how angry and hurt my ex is. i ended my 3+ year relationship on wednesday night with a sweet, kind, gentle man who loved me, but who could not take action on any of the promises he made me.

among other things, he lied to keep the peace, telling me what i wanted to hear so i’d stick around. when we first met, i asked if he’d been tested for stds after his last partner, and he said he had and was clean. a few weeks ago, he actually admitted that he lied and wasn’t tested. can’t hold down a job due to an inflated sense of moral high ground. he financially supports and enables his burnout thief of a brother/roommate who stole from me multiple times, steals from him, never pays his share, and weaponizes incompetence (and that runs in the family…). my ex was a financial mess and still owes me money. he didn’t train or maintain hygiene for his dogs, allowing them to pee/poop in his apartment and jump on me every time i came over, despite my constant worries they’d keep injuring me with their strength and uncut nails. his version of clean? dog hair covering his place, clumps along the baseboards and layers on surfaces. “clean” dishes in the cupboard being visibly dirty when i pulled them out to use. he spent all his time at home playing board/D&D/video games and watching tv, never wanting to go out and do anything despite me asking often.

all of this, and i still kept showing up. i went to his place and swallowed my anxiety and disgust. was friendly and kind to his dogs and his brother. sat in his shitty furniture that made my chronic pain flair up. gave him my body when i didn’t want to. shaved my armpits at his request. bought him so much food, weed, and tokens of love. that was one of my issues that contributed to all this: i enabled his poor behavior for far too long, and didn’t hold him accountable enough. but how many times do i have to remind him? to ask? to plead?

we broke up for a week in may last year, after which he came crawling back promising change. we made lists of our needs and he enthusiastically agreed to all of mine. a year later, he admits that he was never going to train the dogs or maintain their hygiene, he was just telling me what i wanted to hear.

after all this, he was surprised when i ended things on wednesday. i told him it’s because nothing has changed. i brought up my concerns plenty over the last year and tried to be patient, but it’s now getting in the way of my ability to change and grow in the ways i need to in order to be my best self. i deserve a partner who takes my wants, needs, and safety into account and actually takes action to address them. someone with ambition, responsibility, the ability to set goals and work to reach them. an adult partner. not a 40-year old manchild. he said he thinks i’m making a mistake, breaking up with him.

i can’t stop thinking about how angry he is, and how much i know he’s hurting. when we broke up last year, it happened more mutually as we realized how much his dogs and cleanliness were causing issues. we had a tearful goodbye, the most loving but emotional breakup i’ve gone through. i wish this time could’ve gone that way, that we could comfort each other through this. but i know that’s unrealistic. he’s entitled to all his feelings and perception of me, but they should also no longer concern me, right?

i love him. i loved him. but it’s time to let him go and focus on loving myself more… right?",1,2,2025-06-27 22:54:22,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm7mj9/seeking_encouragement_after_ending_a_3_year/,,,Stories like yours make me sad because you really seem like a kindhearted and decent human being and yet you put up with so much shit (literally!) and got nothing but grief and guilt to show for it.

Idk if i should do it in 2 months (if it'll be relevant and ill still be missing her/she and I won't have another partner) but i probably would do it, if ill remember... Only time will tell.  For now, LEAVE HER ALONE NC is the best choice. I unfollowed her and removed her as a follower from instagram 2 days ago bc i couldnt stand it.  You know, id really want to hear from a lot of guys and gals that post here how their life been going in a year or so, how many moved on to another partner, returned to their ex, or still are searching...

First Relationship. Just broke up hours ago. Want to go back. 27M and 27F.,"Hi, new here and reeling. Broke up hours ago. Maybe. A 4:30 AM phone conversation.  
  
**TL;DR** **girlfriend has remarkable qualities, but I can't forge and intellectual connection with her. felt like I was I pushing into something hopeless because it was painful to breakup. But can't convince myself of that after doing it.**   
  
 So I know I could still claw it back if I wanted to. I'm writing here because I don't have anyone else to vent the emotions and conflict to. 

Just got (mostly) out of a long and very bumpy relationship. I broke up twice before, but after each time someone wanted to reconcile. After 3 months of not being together, I wrote her a long letter, every day, for over a month.  I now recognize that action from me to be love bombing, but didn't realize was a negative behavior at the time. 

Can't convince myself this is the right decision, and that I won't only regret it in the coming days and  months, but continue to feel that I made the wrong decision for years and decades.  Though I don't believe in ""fate"" or ""the one,"" I have a hard time thinking I'll find someone with so many good and rare qualities. 

Why break up? No negative behavior in the relationship. No yelling, no screaming, no lying, no cheating. She's kind, soft, and sweet. Emotionally intelligent. Oh, and stunningly beautiful. We're both Catholic, both want a large family, and agree on how to spend money and raise children. Check, check, check. I can hear wedding bells. 

But when thinking about a partner abstractly, I most strongly desire to intellectually connect. I've read my own journals from before I met her that describe that desire. I'm a math major and did some research that got published as an undergraduate.  I've studied Latin and read the Aeneid, learned Russian living in Kyrgyzstan, I am absolutely in love with Shakespeare. She's not from America, speaks English as a second language, and by her own admission, isn't into academics, and doesn't have strong critical thinking skills. Struggles to understand how fraction multiplication works. This *constantly* lives in the forefront of my mind, and the only time I'm not thinking about it is when we're being physical. 

I have sincerely wished at times that I wasn't so smart. I see how it gives me a superiority complex, and how I struggle to connect with people who don't have a similar IQ. I tutor a 14 year old kid in Calculus who complains that he has no friends at community college because everyone there is stupid. I tell him,  ""you can't just judge people by the thing you're the best at, there are so many skills out there, and you have to find the part of each person that makes them shine."" But I can't take that medicine myself somehow. I've tried. 

I only got my IQ tested because of this issue in the relationship. Cognimetrics says I'm 98.06%. That really narrows my dating pool to almost no one if I select for that. The problem is **I don't want to select for that intelligence, but I can't control my emotions and attraction around it**. I feel destined to be alone, to not meet anyone like that until I'm 40, or to settle for something smart who is lacking in other, ostensibly more important categories, like fidelity, trustworthiness, religious compatibility, financial compatibility, and physical attraction. My current (ex?) parnter has those in spades. 

Is this a male version of girl who needs to ""settle"" for more stable guy rather than hot motorcycler with a felony that won't treat her right? Do I just need to adjust my standards to realistically find someone who meets most, but not all, of my preferences? Is there a way to do that? Or am I pushing into a relationship that I'll never feel happy in, and end up leading us both into a joyless and mutually destructive marriage? I'm leaning toward the second, but would love some perspective from others. 

I'm religious and have tried prayer, and got no answers. I've tried thinking deeply about it in a non-religious way, talking with friends, and with therapists, and even my partner. None of those methods have gotten me anywhere for the year that I've felt this way. Can r/breakups give any insight? Thanks to anyone who read this far or even skimmed.

Blindsided by my ex gf. we share 2 kids,"Its been almost 3months after she left me. We were together 5,5 years. One morning she was giving me a ride to work and as we were driving she suddenly said that she has no feelings towards me anymore and that she wants to break up and that theres problems that shouldve been fixed for a long time ago. Sad part is she didnt communicate with me before this. She always said she never wants to lose me and 2weeks before she left she said that she wants me as her husband like she has said it earlier too. 

There has been times ive noticed her being off but when i ask ”is something wrong” she just answers ”nothing, everything is ok.” happened many times i now understand it tho that she just didnt have it in her to say it out loud what was bothering her. And its what makes it even more sad. I was willing to take her back at first if she wanted to try again like i would for the kids also and for me and for us. But as time has passed by and been nearly 3 months i have this feeling that i couldnt take her back anymore after what she done to me. 

1month after the breakup she texted me that her car broke and asked what might be the problem.
I responded ”sorry these are none of my business anymore… please only contact about our children nothing else im just trying to move on”
her respond was ”ok be an asshole then”
like she left me out the blue and expects me to be interested helping her with her car when its been so little time.. and it wasnt even me not wanting to help more of that i couldnt i was so broken at that time it was like hell. i just didnt want to hear from her anything that wasnt about our children.

"Love is not guaranteed, it is not even hardy","hardy: robust; capable of enduring difficult conditions.

I think I naively thought that love could overcome anything, so long as the love was strong enough. And perhaps this is how society taught us, or a over romanticization of love like in the Hollywood films, but it was a sucker punch to the gut to learn that it cannot. 

During our relationship, I broke up with her twice because she was very clingy and sometimes toxic about it, and we had a ton of problems and arguments and an uncountable number of incompatibilities. And at the end of our arguments we asked each other and so what do we do? And we both didn't know. 

She eventually broke up with me and I have been feeling devastated since, and it's hard to come to terms with the fact that love doesn't simply overcome everything. Just it is so amazing and beautiful, but the truth for so many of us is that it is not all-powerful. And that's just so heartbreaking.",1,0,2025-06-27 22:23:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm6xar/love_is_not_guaranteed_it_is_not_even_hardy/,,,

"27M, alone for the first time in 12 years jumping from relationship to relationship","The title pretty much explains it.

Some part of it was me being a dumbass and hiding from having to process breakups, while other times things just came up more naturally.

My last relationship was pretty short, around 2 months long, but it left a mark on me.

I know I have to go through this and be alone for some time, but I'm having a hard time not having anyone to say good night or good morning to, along with chatting through the day. Childish, I know.

"my goodbye letter, is it okay?","My Dearest Braeden. I am deeply sorry I messed up, i was scared. scared of how much I felt, how deeply I was falling for you, how soon I’d have to leave. So I did what people sometimes do when they’re afraid: I said things I shouldn’t have. I tried to protect myself from the pain I saw coming, and in doing that, I created a wound neither of us deserved. I said the wrong things. I made it harder than it had to be. And for that… I’m truly sorry. But please know the distance never meant I didn’t want to try. And the words I said in a moment of panic were not stronger than the feelings that bloomed every time you made me laugh, or touched my hand, or simply looked at me like I was something precious. You were, and still are, something precious to me. if I could do it all again, I would still choose you... Even if it hurts. All I get to keep is the memory of our brief, beautiful summer i spent looking into your eyes. Even if I was the one who made the mistake, I can’t stop aching from the silence you left behind. You vanished from my life in a way that felt like a wound I warned you about (!) one I begged you not to open. I don’t think you understand how deeply I needed you to stay. And now, I’m left facing the weight of my words, my regrets, and this cruel distance with nothing but pain. Mental illness has a cruel way of making the softest things feel dangerous. And I know I carry damage, I know I’m difficult to love when I’m splitting, but I wish you had stayed long enough to see that I was trying to be better for you. I was scared... I never imagined Canada would leave such a bitter taste in my mouth, I don’t think I want to set foot in this country again. When i go back to my hometown, i’m gonna train for modeling, it’s been my dream for a while but haven’t told anyone about it… and obviously, playing guitar. Wherever you go, I hope you remember me not for my mistakes, but for the girl who looked into your eyes and saw the sky. The girl who would’ve given you the whole world if she could. And maybe still would.

It’s a nice sounding letter, but usually confessing love and feelings and saying nice things to people that have left you only pushes them further away and makes you look desperate. I don’t know if I would mention that you were too scared and too in love and that’s why you acted out and said, and did mean things. I wouldn’t use being afraid and protecting yourself to justify your actions. If you wanna say something, you can just say you were emotionally, immature, and handled your emotions poorly and lacked control, but you’re working on it. I would try to make it sound less lovely and emotional and more down to the point.   “Hi Braden, I just wanted to leave you with some final words to take accountability and apologize for my actions. I acted in emotionally immature ways, and I took out my issues on you. I deeply regret my actions, but it’s a wake up call for me to work on becoming the best version of myself.  I’m going to spend my time working on my shortcomings through therapy and other practices so I can become the best person possible.   Thank you for all the wonderful memories.

"I haven’t broken up with her yet — but I know I will tomorrow, and it’s breaking me already","This is hard to write, but I need to say it somewhere. I (16M) have been in an on-and-off relationship with a girl (16F) for about a year and a half. We were each other’s first real love. It started out intense and meaningful — first kisses, first holidays together, long phone calls, gifts, hoodies that smelled like each other. The kind of relationship you feel deep in your chest.

But it’s also had a lot of pain. We broke up the first time mainly because I wasn’t okay with how close she was to certain guys. I’ll admit this now — I was immature and insecure. She wasn’t cheating, and I reacted like she was. I lost all trust, even when there wasn’t a reason to. I got a bit controlling because I thought I was “protecting” her, but it came from fear and jealousy. I hurt her mentally toward the end of our first run, not with words I meant to say, but just by being negative and not the person I should’ve been.

Eventually, she gave me a second chance. I changed. I genuinely matured. I stopped being that insecure guy and tried to grow up because I still loved her. And for a while, it felt like things were finally working.

But now it’s ending — again. And this time it’s breaking me even more because I feel it’s final.

She’s about to go to a motorsport college. That’s her dream — she’s passionate about racing and engineering. But the truth is, that world is male-dominated. It’s all guys. And she’s already started building connections before she’s even gone. I get it. She’s never had many close friends, and this college is everything to her. She said she needs space, time to reset, heal from stress, and build her career. She’s not doing anything wrong. She's not cheating. She’s being upfront. And I trust her.

But even though I trust her, I’ve still found myself falling back into my old patterns. I’ve been constantly checking her reposts, her location, seeing who she’s messaging in the college group chat. Not because she’s done anything wrong — just because I’m scared. Insecure again. I know it’s toxic. I’ve tried to stop, but I can’t. And that’s not fair on her.

When I first found out about her group chat full of college guys, all those insecurities hit me like a truck again. And even though she wasn’t messaging them privately or being shady, I spiraled. That was the last straw for her. She broke up with me — or at least, tried to. But we kind of fell into this weird space where we’re still technically together right now. But I’ve made up my mind.

I’m going to end it tomorrow.

It hurts more than anything. I ripped off the bracelet she gave me today. I deleted all our photos, even though we haven’t officially broken up yet. I changed my profile picture from a photo of us to just me. I’ve had to act dry and distant on the phone just to survive this weird limbo. I’ve cried. I still have a hoodie that smells like her, and I don’t know if I’ll ever wear it again.

Part of me keeps looking at her smile in old photos and thinking — why are you about to hurt someone who clearly loves you? But deep down, I know why. It’s not that she’s bad or I’m bad. We just want different things now. She wants space. I want closeness. She wants time to find herself. I want someone who’s already choosing me.

And the truth is... I’ve started talking to someone else again. A girl I used to know, who’s everything I want right now. She’s loving, she’s committed, she wants me deeply and is fully ready to give everything to a relationship. My friends think she’s better for me. Even my family sees the difference.

But my love for my ex always clouded that. It was stronger — not better, just more intense. But now that I know I’m letting go, it’s like I can see what I really want. I just need a few weeks to heal. I’m not jumping into anything. I want to be better before I try again with someone new.

I’m scared about tomorrow. I’m scared I’ll cry. I’m scared I’ll regret it. I already feel guilty, even though I know it’s right. But we can’t love each other the way we need to right now. And maybe in another life, we could’ve made it work. But not in this one.

If anyone’s been through something similar — letting go even though you still love them — how did you survive the aftershock?

I also broke up with someone I still loved a couple of years ago. (Different reason why I'm in this sub now) It still was the most painful thing I'd gone through up to that point in my life. I also experienced deep regret and questioning, even though what I did was right. Stay strong. Don't cave and get back together. If you are like me, you'll want to go running back to them even though you know it's right to be apart. Going no-contact was necessary for me. I had to temporarily limit access to mutual friends (this was temporary, but necessary). I did a lot of reading about breakups and a lot of processing. Don't ignore how you're feeling and don't rebound. You mention another girl you're talking to. Give it some time. Don't jump into that relationship. it risks being a rebound and you need time to heal before pursuing this other girl. Spend time with other people, even if you don't feel like it. It will hurt like hell but you'll get through it. I promise. ||| you’re feeling everything because love isn’t a switch you flip—it’s a weight you carry, then learn to put down   letting go while still loving is the hardest kind of courage   it’s not about forgetting or erasing   it’s about *making space* for what’s real now, not just what you want to hold onto  don’t rush the healing or expect yourself to bounce back fast   grief, hope, relief, regret—they all mingle in this mess   but each day you show up and breathe is progress  lean into the new connection only when you’re ready—don’t force the timeline   your love for her is proof you’re capable of depth   use that depth to build the self who can give and receive fully next time  and yeah   it’s gonna hurt   but you’ll be stronger when the pain finally settles  The [NoFluffWisdom Newsletter](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/Subscribe) has some brutal, no-BS advice on moving through love and loss might help steady the ship"
if you came here looking for that breakup thing i mentioned…,"yup. still have it.  
a soft little survival kit.  
for the nights when the silence hurts more than the relationship did.  
panic page. no-contact log. glow-up checklist.  
nothing perfect. just stuff that kept me here when i didn’t want to be.  
some people messaged and said it helped.  
that means more than you know.",1,0,2025-06-27 21:56:55,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm6b1x/if_you_came_here_looking_for_that_breakup_thing_i/,,,
people keep asking me what i used to stop spiraling after my breakup,"so here it is:  
i didn’t use an app. didn’t do a course.  
i literally wrote a panic page in my notes app.  
made a checklist. a tracker. some hard-truth reminders.  
then turned it into a messy little healing kit.  
now i send it to people who dm me.  
if you’re following me because you’re not okay — i wasn’t either.  
but this helped.",1,0,2025-06-27 21:56:01,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm6acb/people_keep_asking_me_what_i_used_to_stop/,,,
if you found me through one of those “i texted them again” posts…,"same.  
this kit i made? didn’t come from healing. it came from breaking down too many times.  
i got tired of my own relapses.  
so i built a page to read when i spiral.  
a tracker to stay clean.  
a journal that doesn’t ask me to be wise — just honest.  
i shared it with a few people already. if you’re hurting quietly, yeah, i got you too.",0,0,2025-06-27 21:55:40,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm6a28/if_you_found_me_through_one_of_those_i_texted/,,,
"hey, if you’re following me after my breakup posts…","just wanted to say i see you.  
this kind of pain feels invisible to most people, but not here.  
if you’re stuck in the spiral — checking their profile, rewriting texts, crying quietly in your room — yeah. i was too.  
i made something for it.  
no contact tracker, panic blocker, journal page, reminders.  
it’s not therapy. it’s just what helped me stop breaking myself.  
i’ve sent it to people who messaged before. you can ask too.",0,0,2025-06-27 21:55:09,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm69nu/hey_if_youre_following_me_after_my_breakup_posts/,,,
How to get over a niche person?,"As the title says, how do you get over someone that’s so niche and specific? 

Everyone says you can find another them but what if you really can’t? 25 years and I’ve only met ONE person like him and that’s him. I get it I’m still young and there’s so much time and I have so much life to live and relationships to have but this one hurts the most. 

To give some backstory, music is very important to me because all of my exes didn’t really share the same music taste as me and I love going to concerts and they either didn’t come or they did and they very much acted like I dragged them to it. When I met this guy, it was perfect. We had the same exact music taste, our energies meshed perfectly. Even more than my closest friends. We shared the same sense of humor, the same values. It’s like we were made for each other.

Things were going well for a while and it seemed like we were going to be in a relationship but when the 3 month mark hit and I noticed it wasn’t going anywhere I got extremely anxious. He started being more distant towards me, leaving me on delivered for hours on end while he was active on social media, plans we made days even a week in advance started getting fucked up because he was inconsiderate of my time. One night I got a weird feeling and decided to use this app that’s meant to find a specific persons tinder profile and lo and behold, he was on there. It said when the account was created and he made it 3 days before I found it. We had a big argument and that’s when he told me he changed his mind and wasn’t ready for relationship and he went on there to “see what’s out there.” It destroyed me. Literally the next week he hung out twice with the same girl and I crashed out on him and of course he told me that they’re just friends. 

The worst part about it is that I somewhat believe him. I don’t think he’s a bad guy, I think he has a good heart but he’s really confused and he’s genuinely going through a hard time. It hurts that I got caught up in all of this because I was genuinely so good to him. There’s waaay more lore but it’s too much for me to get into right now. I guess I could technically get him cancelled because he is somewhat of a public figure in the local hardcore scene but I’m not petty enough to do something like that. 

He said we could be friends and maybe try dating again in the future but idk. How do you get over someone who’s so niche and you know you probably won’t find again?",1,0,2025-06-27 21:54:39,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm697y/how_to_get_over_a_niche_person/,,,
the internet said “just block them” so i built a whole system instead,"blocking them is step 1.  
step 2 is resisting the urge to unblock 3 days later.  
step 3 is not spiraling on their Spotify activity.  
i made a full survival kit for myself after the 4th failed no-contact attempt.  
panic blocker, tracker, healing checklist, journal — all stuff that actually helped me not lose it.  
some people asked for it after a vent post, so i’ve been sharing it quietly.  
not cute. not polished. just real.",1,0,2025-06-27 21:54:13,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm68ua/the_internet_said_just_block_them_so_i_built_a/,,,
i turned my breakup spiral into a kit. i didn’t think anyone would care.,"literally just made it to keep myself from texting my ex again.  
1 page for the panic moments.  
a checklist for when i couldn’t function.  
journal prompts when therapy felt too far away.  
now people keep DMing me asking for it.  
so yeah — if you’re hurting like that too, i’ll send it.",0,0,2025-06-27 21:53:48,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm68h5/i_turned_my_breakup_spiral_into_a_kit_i_didnt/,,,
i didn’t find a breakup guide that worked… so i made my own,"every “healing” post online felt too pretty for what i was actually going through.  
like cool, i’ll “glow up” but right now i can’t even eat or stop checking if they watched my story.  
so i built my own kit.  
panic page. no contact tracker. journal prompts for when your chest is tight at 2am.  
i’ve sent it to a few people who asked — it’s not fancy, but it helped me survive.  
if you're in that spiral too, it’s there.",1,0,2025-06-27 21:53:16,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm6807/i_didnt_find_a_breakup_guide_that_worked_so_i/,,,
"journaling, walks, therapy — nothing helped until i made this","i tried all the stuff people say to do after a breakup.  
some of it helped. most of it didn’t.  
what actually changed things was building my own recovery plan.  
– one page for when i wanted to text them  
– daily no-contact tracker  
– soft routine checklist just to stay alive and functioning  
it started as survival. now i’ve been sharing it with people who ask.  
it’s not a miracle fix. but it’s real.",1,0,2025-06-27 21:52:51,,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1lm67mp/journaling_walks_therapy_nothing_helped_until_i/,,,
